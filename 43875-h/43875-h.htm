<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE BOY CHUMS.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Golly!</span> I'm getting powerful tired ob dis.
Fish what just clusterers 'round youah bait an'
won't bite at hit noways is jest trifling and noaccount.
I reckon dey's too ornery an' too finiky
anyway to be fit to eat. Well, here goes again,
though hit ain't no use. I'se dun spit on mah bait
fifty times, an' rubbed hit twice with my rabbit's
foot, but hit doan' do a bit of good. Dey jes' look
at hit an' grin like white folks at a nigger's wedding."
The little ebony negro who had spoken
let drop his daintily baited hook into the water
again with a gesture of disgust.</p>

<p>"Let me have a look at them, Chris," said another
voice, and a white face joined the black, as
the two peered over the edge of the bridge down
into the crystal-clear depths of the water below.</p>

<p>The white boy straightened up after a brief
glance into the azure waters. He was tall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sturdily built, with lines of self-reliance and determination
upon his youthful face. His mouth widened
into a grin of amusement, as he watched the
little negro peering anxiously down at the circle
of black-circle-eyed fish that crowded eagerly but
warily around the baited hook.</p>

<p>"You're fooling away your time, Chris," said the
white lad. "Look here." He chopped up a
few pieces of bait and flung them over beside the
other's line. As they slowly sank there was turmoil
and confusion amongst the finny observers
below. With swirl and splash they darted up and
seized upon the tiny fragments.</p>

<p>Chris wound up his line with a snort of disgust.
"Dey are conjured, clean conjured," he declared;
"going clean out ob their way to get bait when dar
was plenty right afore 'em. Them's sure some
fool fishes, Massa Charles."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," said the other boy lightly.
"They are mangrove snappers, the foxiest fish that
swims. Some one of them got hurt on a hook
some time, and his misfortune has become history
among the tribe. I guess that's what makes the
black circles around their eyes. They just keep
worrying so about getting hold of another tempting
morsel with a hook attached that they don't eat
half enough, and are fast worrying themselves into
nervous prostration."</p>

<p>The little negro snorted, and continued to wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
up his line, while his white companion paused to
gaze with appreciation at the beautiful scene spread
out to his view. At the shore end of the high railroad
bridge upon which they stood was Jupiter, a
tiny nest of white houses, almost lost among the
glossy green palms and vivid blazing tropical flowers.
Below them flowed the blue waters of the
Laxahatchu River. To the west, the river broke
into a dozen parts, each flowing swiftly between
as many shoals and islands, and finally losing itself
in the distance. To the east, it joined the sea,
scarce a mile distant, the breakers meeting the
river's waters in a tumbling mass of foam. A
little below the bridge, on the opposite side of the
river from Jupiter, three government buildings
rose up from a high bluff&mdash;a wireless station, a
weather bureau office, and a towering lighthouse,
built long, long before the civil war. Beyond
these, down close to the inlet, the lad's eyes focused
upon a long point, jutting out into the river,
upon which stood two small tents. From the inlet
a rowboat, with two occupants, was approaching
the point with the long easy strokes characteristic
of experienced boatmen.</p>

<p>The lad turned to his black companion. "Come
on, let's go back to camp, Chris," he said. "The
Captain and Walter are nearly there now."</p>

<p>"Better look to youah line. De slack's running
out like mad, Massa Charles," chided the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
darkey. "Golly! I don't know what you white
chillens would do widout dis nigger. 'Pears like
you white chillens can't even fish widout Chris
along to tell you-alls when you got a bite."</p>

<p>But Charley had already sprung for the coiled-up
line, which was whizzing out at a rapid rate.
Taking a turn around a post, he endeavored to
stop the hook's victim in its mad career, but, as the
long, heavy line tauted like a bar of iron, he realized
that he stood a chance of losing both line and fish,
and he paid out the balance of the line very
slowly. It was not until the very end of the line
was reached that the fish suddenly changed its
tactics and, turning short, rushed for the bridge.</p>

<p>Charley yanked in the slack line swiftly and
called to Chris to come to his assistance. Near
the bridge the fish turned again and sped for the
far-off inlet, both boys clinging to the line in a
vain attempt to check the outward rush.</p>

<p>"Golly!" panted Chris, as the line dragged
slowly and burningly through his grip. "Hit's
lucky we ain't got this line tied to no post. Dat
fish would sure pull de whole bridge ober."</p>

<p>"Rats!" laughed Charley, as he grabbed out his
pocket handkerchief and hastily wrapped it
around one hand to protect it from the burning
line, "isn't the bridge bearing the whole strain as
long as we are standing on it?"</p>

<p>"Course it ain't," maintained the little negro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
pantingly, "ain't my back beginning to ache, an'
my arms get lame, an' mah hands burn like fire?
Golly! You white chillens sho' don't use no logic
or reason. Maybe you ain't holdin' back hard
enough to feel hit, but I'se sho' getting de strain,
not dis pesky ole bridge."</p>

<p>"Well, you will not have to bear it much
longer," Charley grinned. "Don't you notice that
the strain is getting weaker all the time? He's a
monster, but he's evidently swallowed the hook
clean down, and that's why he is giving up so fast.
We'll have the best of him in a few minutes."</p>

<p>The lad's prophecy proved true, for, long before
the end of the line was reached, the fish began
circling in ever-narrowing circles until, at last, the
two boys were able to tow it up slowly to the
shore.</p>

<p>"Golly!" exclaimed Chris, as the fish's huge bulk
came into view. "Dat's de biggest an' ugliest fish
I ever catched. What is hit, anyway?"</p>

<p>Charley glanced down at the short, thick, black
body and the huge, gasping, red mouth. "It's a
Jew fish," he announced. "I guess it weighs about
800 pounds, but that's not so very much, when you
consider that they sometimes grow to weigh over
1,800. Unlike most big fish, however, they are
very good eating. Wind up the fish line, and then
cut out some good big steaks. They will make
dandy fish balls and chowder. While you're doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that, I'll run up to the village and tell everyone to
come down and help themselves, then I'll bring the
launch around from the dock and pick you up."</p>

<p>Soon after his departure the villagers began to
arrive in twos and threes, but not before Chris had
cut out several fine steaks from the huge fish. By
the time he wound up his line, washed the steaks
carefully and strung them upon a piece of cocoanut
fiber, Charley hove in sight in a little motor
boat. He ran up as close as he dared to the shore
and stopped his engine. "Hurry up and climb
aboard," he called, "we want to get back to camp
before dark."</p>

<p>Chris waded out, treading gingerly with bare
feet over the oyster shells that strewed the bottom.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," laughed Charley, "your feet are
too tough to be hurt by oyster shells."</p>

<p>The little darkey grinned as he clambered aboard.
"Dat ain't de point," he protested. "I was reckoning
dat some ob dem oysters might be alive, an'
I sho' would have hated to crush de life out ob
dem."</p>

<p>Charley threw over the wheel and started up the
motor, and the little boat, whirling around, darted
away for the distant point with its two snow-white
tents. A few minutes' run brought them close to
it, and Charley steered round into a cove, to avoid
the tide wash, and ran the boat up on the shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
The anchor was taken out and imbedded in the
sand. The motor was covered and everything
made snug for the night. Then the two boys
strolled forward with their burdens for the tents.</p>

<p>Although it was not yet dark, a big fire of fragrant,
spicy, mangrove wood blazed before the
tent. A little ways from it on blocks of driftwood
sat a boy of about Charley's own age, while close
beside him sat an elderly man with a heavy beard.
The boy was opening oysters, while the man was
carefully breaking turtle eggs into a big pan beside
him, taking care to let only the yolks fall into
the pan and throwing away the uncookable whites.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" greeted Charley cheerfully. "What
luck, Walt?"</p>

<p>"Too good," said the boy on the block listlessly.
"Every turtle in the Atlantic must have tried to lay
on the beach along here. Didn't even have the fun
of looking for a nest. They were scattered around
everywhere."</p>

<p>"And you, Captain?" asked Charley, with a grin
at his chum's reply.</p>

<p>"Ran the skiff right up on a bed of oysters," the
old sailor said briefly. "All I had to do was lean
over the side and pick 'em up with my hand&mdash;big,
nice, fat oysters, too."</p>

<p>Charley took a seat on a piece of driftwood, and
silence fell upon the three. Only Chris, with the
high spirits of his race, stamped down the fire into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a bed of glowing coals, and prepared to make an
omelette of the turtle eggs, a stew from the oysters,
and a big pot of coffee, singing as he worked,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ham meat hit am good to eat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bacon's berry fine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But gib, oh, gib me what I long for,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dat watermilen asmiling on de vine."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Charley broke the long silence that had fallen on
the three. "We are getting to be three old
grouches," he said calmly. "We have got the best
of health. We have got $5,000 cash in the bank.
We have been truckers, wreckers, pearl hunters,
plume hunters, spongers, and, lastly, net fishermen,
and have gone through all kinds of hardships and
perils, and yet, after we agreed to take a long vacation
trip and rest up, here after only two weeks
of it we are getting restless and dissatisfied. Am I
right?"</p>

<p>"You are," declared Walter Hazard heartily.
"I admit it. I'm sick of loafing. I want to get
back to real work again."</p>

<p>"It's all right for a while, this lounging about
from place to place, but I reckon I've about got
my fill of it," Captain Westfield admitted. "I had
a heap sight rather be working at something."</p>

<p>"I feel the same way," Charley agreed, "and I
believe I've found the very thing for us, but it's
big&mdash;the biggest thing the Boy Chums ever tackled.
Come on. Chris has got supper ready. We will
talk it over while we eat."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>THE NEW VENTURE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few minutes there was entire silence
while the four devoted their whole attention to
the delicious meal Chris had prepared, and, during
this lull, the reader has time to observe and note
more carefully this little band of old friends, whom
he has doubtless met amid many adventures in the
Boy Chum Series. They have changed but little
since he met them last in "The Young Net Fishermen."
Charley West, the strapping young fellow,
who now sits on one side of the fire eagerly devouring
piping hot omelette and rich oyster stew,
is the same old Charley of yore, his face a trifle
older and more alert, perhaps, from the dangers
and hardships through which he has passed, but
with the same old merry twinkle in his eyes. Walter
Hazard, now grown almost as husky as his
chum, sits next to him, and close beside Walt is
gray-haired Captain Westfield, a sort of guardian
father to them both, a master of the sea, but rather
helpless on land. He, too, is little changed, while
Chris, the little ebony darkey, wears the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
broad, good-natured smile as ever. But we must
stop and listen to the conversation now starting
up, for upon it depends the future of our four
friends.</p>

<p>"Tell us what our next move is to be," Walter
demanded.</p>

<p>"It rests with the rest of you as much as with
me," Charley smiled. "All I am going to do is
to make the suggestion."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said the captain impatiently, "we're
waiting to hear it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Charley, "West of Jupiter about
forty miles lays the great lake Okeechobee. It's
reported by explorers that there's a ten-mile belt
clear around the lake of the richest land in the
world. Between the lake and Jupiter there is only
one little trading-post, called Indiantown. All the
way leads through swamps, prairies, and pine barrens.
There is a sort of road, but it is under water
for about six months in the year."</p>

<p>"All that's interesting, but what has it got to
do with us?" said Waiter impatiently.</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that in a minute," said Charley
placidly. "Last year the county commissioners
passed a law for the building of a dirt road from
Jupiter to the lake, and a man named Murphy
made a bid of 17½ cents a yard for the dirt handled
and he got the contract. He bought a steam
shovel with a 1½-yard bucket. He went to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and has got about ten miles of the road completed.
Now he wants to sell out his machine and contract.
Says his wife in Connecticut is sick, and he's got
to go back and stay with her. I saw him in Jupiter
to-day, and he told me he would sell machine,
tents, a team of mules, and the contract for one-third
of what the machine alone cost him, $3,000.
I didn't promise him anything, but said we would
ride out and look at it in the morning. It looks to
me like a good chance to establish ourselves in a
good steady business. There's about thirty miles
of the road yet to build. And he says there are
plenty more contracts to be had for the asking. The
machine can dig one and one-half cubic yards of
earth per minute, and, at 17½ cents per yard,
that's some money, I'm thinking. Besides it works
nights as well as days. Well, what do you think
about it?"</p>

<p>Walter looked rather disappointed. "That
sounds all right," he admitted, "but there doesn't
seem much chance of having any fun, adventure
or excitement out of such a job."</p>

<p>"Adventure, excitement!" echoed Charley.
"Why, I don't know where you'd be more likely
to find both. Remember, we are going through an
almost unknown country. Right through the Indians'
hunting grounds, and through a country
alive with snakes and game."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed Walter, with eyes shining.
"I vote yes for the steam shovel."</p>

<p>"I don't know about it," said the Captain doubtfully.
"It ain't a good plan generally to go into a
business that you don't know anything about."</p>

<p>"But we will soon learn," protested Charley vigorously.
"If we buy, Murphy has agreed to stay
on for a couple of weeks until we get on to the
run of things."</p>

<p>"Well," consented the old sailor reluctantly. "It
won't do any harm to look at the critter, though
I guess I won't be able to tell as much about her
as I would about a sea-going craft."</p>

<p>"Well, how about you, Chris?" Charley inquired.</p>

<p>The little negro grinned. "Golly, Massa Charley,
I reckon I'm pretty well satisfied as I is. Don't
reckon you-alls ebber seed a nigger but was willing
to lay around in de sun all day an' do nothin' but
eat an' fish, but if you-alls are goin' into any foolish
projectin's, I reckon dis nigger will hab to go
along to keep you outer trouble."</p>

<p>"Then it's settled," Charley declared with satisfaction.
"We will get an early start in the morning
and drive out and see just how things are going."</p>

<p>Thus settled, an early hour next morning found
them on the way, drawn in a rickety wagon behind
a lean mule with a wicked-looking eye. There was
no danger of their losing their way for the machine-made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
road stretched out before them a
smoothed mound of earth flanked on each side by
deep ditches made by the removed dirt. At places
the road was raised a full four feet above the surrounding
land, while at other places it descended
gradually to a mere two feet.</p>

<p>Charley viewed it with satisfaction. "That's the
kind of work I want to do," he said. "The kind
of work that creates something, that helps people,
gives them employment, and makes them happy.
Take that road, for instance," he continued dreamily,
"of course it is only a road, but it will open up
the way to thousands of acres of rich land, and
give thousands of people a chance to own a home
and farm."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the Captain testily, who was hot
and sweating under the blazing sun, "and it will
drive away the Indians from their last hunting
ground, and the people who will flock in will be
Huns, Polacks and Japs, and most of them will
die off with the malaria, and the rest, after they
have raised their crops, will find it costs them
more to get them to market than they are worth.
Say, Chris, can't you spread more sail on that craft
of yours? I allow that there ain't much breeze,
but surely it can do more than a mile an hour."</p>

<p>Chris, who was driving the melancholy beast,
obediently leaned forward and brought his tattered
hat down on the mule's flank. "Get up, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Clarence; wake up, you mule," he shouted&mdash;and
Clarence woke up. What had simply been before
a saddened, downcast, plodding mule, became a
marvel of upstanding ears, bared teeth and flying
hoofs. Charley landed with a bump on the side of
the road. Walter, close beside him, and the Captain
not far away, while Chris, disdaining solid
ground, lit far over in the ditch of stagnant water
and mud. The cart, a battered wreck in front,
with one thill gone, still remained, while Clarence,
still enveloped in his harness and dragging the
other thill behind him, with leaping bounds was
headed back for home.</p>

<p>Captain Westfield arose slowly and painfully,
and felt gently of his trousers' seat. "I reckon
Chris crowded on a wee bit too much sail," he said
mildly.</p>

<p>Chris crawled out of the ditch, spitting out mud
and water. "Golly, dat Clarence sho' can move
some," he exclaimed admiringly, as he gazed after
the vanishing mule. "Who would hab thought dat
a little slap of the hat could liven him up so?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it was that, at all," laughed Walter,
as he regained his feet. "I believe he took
offense at being called Clarence, as any self-respecting
mule would&mdash;probably his real name is Maud."</p>

<p>"You fellows can laugh, if you see anything
funny in it," stated Charley reproachfully. "You
wouldn't if you were me. You lit on the sand or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
water, but I landed broadside on a slab of rock.
Well, there's no use trying to catch Clarence. He's
singing 'Home, Sweet Home,' with four feet. I
guess we are as near the camp as we are Jupiter,
so we might as well go ahead."</p>

<p>So ahead they marched, looking more like a trio
of hoboes than possible investors in a big enterprise.
A walk of a few miles brought them in
sight of a cluster of white tents, and they hastened
their steps, knowing that their destination was not
far ahead. They paused at the first tent, the largest
of the cluster, and evidently the eating tent, for
they could see through the open flap two long tables
with rude seating benches running down the
middle, and a heap of tin dishes on a table in one
corner. Outside a big, powerful, sweating negro
was kneading bread on a dirty-looking bench, upon
which a protruding stove-pipe from the tent was
sending down fine flakes of soot.</p>

<p>"Mister Murphy's dun fudder up the road
apiece by the machine," he informed them in reply
to their questions. "Be you gentlemen going
to stay for dinner?"</p>

<p>They told him that they were not sure as yet,
and hurried up the road, eager to be away from
the odors of the camp.</p>

<p>"Golly," exclaimed Chris, "did you-alls notice
de bench dat nigger was makin' bread on? I'll
bet dar was a solid inch ob dirt on de top ob hit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Dat nigger's been scaling fish, chopping up meat,
and making bread on dat same bench for de past
six months widout washin' hit up once. Huh, if I
was his boss I'd give him a licking for sho'."</p>

<p>A few minutes' walk brought them in sight of
the big steam shovel, which was doing the work of
two hundred men with wheelbarrows. It looked
simple enough, a kind of short steel car, resting
upon sections of railroad track. Upon the car was
mounted, on a kind of ratchet work of iron, a
swinging steel platform, from which projected out
a long tapering steel boom, at the end of which
dangled from wire ropes a huge steel bucket with
wicked looking big teeth. Wire ropes an inch and
a half thick led down the boom and wound, coil
upon coil, around the big controlling drums on the
platform below. Two gigantic cog-wheels controlled
the lowering and raising of the huge boom
in front. Just back of the big revolving drums and
cog-wheels a second little platform arose from the
first. It was iron-hooded overhead, but in front it
was open, and behind the opening, with before
him six huge brass levers, stood a man controlling
the movements of this mighty worker. Even as
the little party watched, the great shovel plunged
down, straight down, burying its great teeth in the
rooty ground. The drag rope pulled it in until
it had gathered up a full load of earth. The boom
lifted slightly, the platform swung around, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
bucket dropped its load. For five minutes Charley
watched the operation repeated, with his watch in
his hand. "Murphy hasn't lied about that," he
said. "They are digging a bucket a minute, all
right. Let's figure it out: One and one-half yards
a minute, that's 26 cents a minute; multiplying that
by 60 minutes in the hour, makes $15.60 per hour,
and 24 hours in the day, makes $374.40 per day.
That's going some, I guess."</p>

<p>"Whew," whistled Walter, "that's just like finding
money."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>INVESTIGATING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> working of the powerful machine had been
observed from a distance. As the little party drew
nearer, they could see more plainly the heaps of
mud and wet dirt left in the wake of the steam
shovel. Five gigantic negroes, with shovels and
hoes, leveled off the piles, working slowly and languidly
over the task, their legs wet to the knees
and their bodies plastered with mud.</p>

<p>"Saws, all of them." Charley commented briefly,
as they passed the sudden, slow-working group.</p>

<p>"Saws?" echoed Walter questioningly. "I never
heard of that race before."</p>

<p>"They come from the Bahama Islands," Charley
replied. "They all have to ship for this country
by way of the port of Nassau. So they get their
title from that port, but people on this side have
shortened the title down to 'Saws.' They are the
finest built and laziest race in existence, I believe.
There, that's Mr. Murphy, right back of the machine.
He hasn't seen us yet. Whew! Just listen
to him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Murphy, a short, florid-faced man, was
standing with his back to them, cursing earnestly
at two negroes, who guided the moving of the sections
of track and cleared away all roots and brush
from the machine's path. The negroes' faces were
ashen with anger, but they worked on sullenly,
probably because the butt of a heavy revolver protruded
from the white man's pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy's face became wreathed in smiles,
and he ceased his cursing to greet the little party
cordially.</p>

<p>"You've just got to cuss at them Saws occasionally,"
he apologized, as he rubbed the sweat
from his red face. "If you don't, you just simply
can't get any work out of them. Well, I'm glad to
see you. I expected you early and had given you
up. Well, there's the machine, and you can see
for yourself what kind of work it does. I've got
my contract with the county commissioners back
in my tent, but I'll show it to you when we go
back to dinner, so that you'll see everything is
O. K. Any questions you want to ask?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Charley, with a smile. "We don't
want to go into anything blindfolded. First, what
are your monthly expenses?"</p>

<p>Murphy wrinkled his brow in thought. "Let's
see," he said. "We work the engineers in shifts
of 8 hours each. They get $85.00 a month and
board; that's $255.00. Then there's two shifts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the firemen and ground men; that makes six men
at $36.00 a month&mdash;a total of $216.00. Then, I
have to carry two bridge builders at the same wage,
which makes $72.00 more. Then there's five graders,
one cook, and one teamster, and a dynamiter
to blow up the trees ahead of the machine; that's
eight more, at $36.00, or $288.00. That brings
my total payroll up to a little over $800 a month.
Then, there's the grub bill. It runs from $250 to
$300 a month. Carbide for machine lights, feed
for the mules, and other extras will likely bring
the total expenses for a month up to $1,200, but
that's a trifle compared to what the machine is
earning, and $3,000 for the bunch is like giving it
away. The machine alone cost $12,000, and the
tents, mules, wagons, and the motor truck would
be cheap at another thousand dollars." He pulled
a big watch out of his pocket and looked at the
time. "Chuck's ready by now at the cook tent,"
he said. "Let's go and have a bite, and I'll run
you into Jupiter in the truck afterward. We can
talk business on the way."</p>

<p>In the cook tent they found one long table filled
up with big, black, sweating negroes. At the other
smaller one were seated the teamster&mdash;a white man&mdash;and
the two sleepy-eyed engineers, off duty. The
food was plenty, but coarse and cheap in quality.
Hungry as they were, the boys partook of it meagerly,
for they could not forget that dirty bench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
outside, and the inside was foul from the sweating
negroes crowded into it. One thing they all noticed
was the sullen silence that prevailed. Even
the white men at their own table had nothing to
say, except to ask occasionally for the passing of
some dish they could not reach. The boys were
glad when the meal was at last finished and they
were able to get out again into the sweet, sun-purified
air. Mr. Murphy remained behind for a few
minutes, arguing loudly with the two engineers.</p>

<p>"I don't like the looks of this outfit very much,"
said Walter, as the four gathered together at the
base of a pine tree. "The whole camp is filthy&mdash;tents,
cooking, men, and everything else. And
everyone appears so sullen and ugly, as though a
little thing would start a fight going. Of course,
the price is dirt cheap, but I don't like the looks of
things."</p>

<p>"We can alter things in short order," Charley
declared eagerly, for he was letting his eagerness
to seize this new opportunity cloud his usually clear
judgment. "Why, it won't take any time to change
things around. We can stop the machine for a
day, and turn all hands in on the job, make them
scrub the tents good with soap and water, and,
after they are dry, pitch them all again in a different
place. A change of cooks, and Sunday to rest
up in, will take away a lot of that sullenness, I bet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
I really believe that half of it is caused by Murphy
cursing the men so much."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right," Walter admitted. "Anyway,
I would like to learn to run that steam
shovel. I bet I could do it in a week."</p>

<p>"I don't ever want to have to climb aboard that
critter," Captain Westfield observed; "but I reckon
I could stay on the ground and keep the other fellows
up to scratch. I ain't nowise anxious to go
into the business, but I leave it up to you, Charley.
I've never had much to do with shore business.
Just do as you think best, boy."</p>

<p>"I leave it up to you, too, so far as I'm concerned,"
Walter agreed.</p>

<p>"I hopes you-alls do buy it," Chris said, earnestly;
"I sho' wants to do de cookin'; dat dirty nigger
what's doing it now ain't fitting to do hit, no way."</p>

<p>"All right," Charley agreed, reluctantly. "If
it's left up to me to do the deciding, I'll do it,
though I had rather not take all the responsibility.
Well, I'm going to buy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had no time to continue what he was going
to say, for at that moment Mr. Murphy stepped
out of the tent and called to them. "Come around
here to the next tent; that's where my motor truck
is housed."</p>

<p>Walter examined the motor truck carefully. It
was almost new, but it was evident that it had
received rough treatment at the hands of inexperienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
drivers, but its main parts were still good
and unworn.</p>

<p>"Well, what have you decided to do?" asked
Mr. Murphy, as they all clambered aboard the
truck.</p>

<p>"We would like until to-morrow morning to
talk it over," Charley said cautiously.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but the way it stands, I've got to close
up at once," said Mr. Murphy briefly. "I've just
got to get back home to my wife. I've got another
man on my string, and if you fellows don't want
the business I'll just run down to his place and see
him to-night. I'm pretty sure he'll take it."</p>

<p>"All right, then; we'll take it," said Charley
promptly. "Machine, truck, contract, and all
equipment for $3,000."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Mr. Murphy, equally prompt.
"I'll give you a regular bill of sale, covering everything,
as soon as I get to Jupiter. We'll get there
in time to find a notary, I guess."</p>

<p>There was no further chance for conversation,
for, as soon as it was started up, the motor truck
kept all hands busy trying to retain their seats.
The dirt road was full of hollows, bumps and ruts
that sent the truck's occupants bouncing and jarring
from side to side, so that they were not at all
sorry when Jupiter was at last reached. Once
arrived, the notary was hunted up, and the transfer
papers made out. "I'll stay with you two weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and show you how to run the thing," said Mr.
Murphy. "I ought to go at once, but I promised
you I would stay, and I will. I suppose you
will want to pack up and not go back until morning.
So, I guess I'll take this check for $3,000
down to Palm Beach, and get it cashed, and come
back on the early morning train. There's a local
train due for Palm Beach in about five minutes, so
I'll say so long until morning."</p>

<p>The boys were up at the first crack of day, packing
up their few belongings, taking down their
tents, and pulling out their little launch and concealing
it back among the bushes. By sunrise they
were at Jupiter, having rowed over in the skiff,
which they hauled out and left, feeling confident
that it would not be molested until they returned.</p>

<p>They found, upon inquiry at the little station,
that the train would not arrive until nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"Want tickets?" inquired the station agent, who
had answered their questions.</p>

<p>"No," said Charley. "We are waiting for Mr.
Murphy. He's coming up on the train to take us
out to camp. We have bought out his machine
and contracts."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the agent. "What did you
pay him?"</p>

<p>"We got the whole outfit for $3,000," said
Charley proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good Lord!" murmured the agent. "Cash or
check?"</p>

<p>"Check on the Bank of West Palm Beach," answered
Charley less proudly.</p>

<p>The agent glanced at the clock. "Ten minutes
of nine," he said musingly. "The bank opens at
eight. You have got a chance&mdash;just a bare
chance." He shoved over a pad of telegraph
blanks. "Just wire the bank to stop payment on
that check."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Charley, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Because, it's a rotten proposition," declared the
agent earnestly; "rotten all the way through. If
you can stop payment on that check you'll save
losing $3,000, that's all."</p>

<p>Reluctantly Charley filled in a blank and shoved
it over to the agent, who clicked it off rapidly on
the key. When he had finished he came around
from behind the partition. "It was none of my
business, butting in in that way," he apologized,
"but I hate to see a man robbed of his money."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>BUNCOED.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Do</span> you mean to say that Mr. Murphy does not
own the machine, the contract, and all the equipment?"
Charley asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess he owns the stuff out there, all
right," said the agent. "The point is, that in a
year's time he has only completed ten miles of the
road, and, if you have read the contract over carefully,
you will have noticed that it calls for the
completion of the road in two years, or the contractor
is liable to forfeit the machine itself.
There remains thirty miles to do within a year.
And that thirty miles is far harder to do than the
ground Murphy has gone over. He has lost thousands
of dollars upon the work he has done. I
hardly blame him for trying to catch a sucker."</p>

<p>"But," Charley protested, "we saw the machine
work. It digs over a cubic yard of earth a minute,
and, at 17½ cents a yard, that ought to pay
big money."</p>

<p>"It looks all right on paper," answered the agent
wearily, "but it doesn't figure out that way in fact.
You have got to allow for breakdowns, and a host
of troubles you don't expect. The farther out you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
get the more troubles you are going to have. I
cannot tell you all that may happen to you, for I
do not know exactly, and, if I did, it would be
against the rules of the telegraph company for me
to repeat anything I have learned from messages
that have come over the wire. That is a rule an
agent is honor-bound to obey. But I may, however,
give you a hint to be on your guard all the
time. There are powerful people and influences
at work to stop that road-building."</p>

<p>"But why should anyone wish to stop it?" asked
Charley, whose face began to wear an anxious expression.</p>

<p>"That I do not know," answered the agent.
"All I know is that you will not be allowed to
build that road in peace. How far its enemies will
go to stop it, and what their motive is, I cannot
say. But, if I were you, I'd be on the watchout
for trouble right from the start."</p>

<p>"Cheerful news," commented Charley grimly.</p>

<p>"It isn't very joyful tidings, I admit," said the
agent. "I would hate to tackle the job under such
circumstances. The work itself is uncertain
enough to keep any man worrying, without any
trouble from outside. Now you have all the warning
I am permitted to give you, and, if I may, I
would like to ask you what are you going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"Do?" echoed Charley, throwing back his shoulders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
"I coaxed my companions into this deal,
and it's up to me, with their help, to pull out clear."</p>

<p>"Go to it," said Captain Westfield, approvingly.
"We have still got $2,000, and we'll back you up
to the last cent. If we go broke, it will not be
the first time we've been that way."</p>

<p>"You've voiced my sentiments," agreed Walter,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Dis nigger's sho' got to go wid you white chillens,"
Chris joined in. "Don't know what you'd
do widout dis nigger to look out for you-alls."</p>

<p>The agent observed this demonstration of loyalty
with increased interest. "If you all stick by each
other like that, you will do better than Murphy
has, at any rate," he observed. "I'll help you all
I can, but I'm afraid that will not be very much,
but, perhaps, I can drop a hint now and then that
will be of help to you. Well, there goes my telegraph
call. Guess it is an answer to your telegram
to the bank."</p>

<p>In a few minutes he reappeared with the written
message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your message too late; check cashed a few
minutes after eight."</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Bank of West Palm Beach.</span>"<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>"I gossiped a little with the agent at Palm
Beach," he said. "Murphy left there on the southbound
a few minutes ago. He bought a ticket to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Havana. Sorry, boys, I did my best for you, but
it was too late. Well, I hope you will have better
luck than Murphy did. Drop in on me whenever
you feel like it. I have got to get some waybills
ready for the morning freight, now, so will have
to get busy."</p>

<p>The little party thanked him for his kindness
and, strolling down to the dock, sat down to discuss
the new turn of affairs.</p>

<p>"What a chump I am!" exclaimed Charley bitterly.
"Here I've gone and dragged you fellows
into a hopeless proposition, when common sense
should have led me to investigate carefully. It
was too good a bargain not to have some string
fastened to it. One can't get something for nothing
in this world."</p>

<p>"Maybe you were a mite hasty, lad," admitted
the Captain; "but shucks, we all make our little
mistakes. Maybe we can do better than Murphy
did with that big land turtle. It appeared to me
that Murphy wasn't just the kind of a man to handle
a lot of negroes, especially Saws. I could see
there was a pile of dissatisfaction in that camp,
and, when there's trouble in the forecastle, the
ship is never worked right."</p>

<p>"Golly, I don't blame them niggers for looking
sullen and working no account when dey has to
eat grub de way dat cook fixes it up. I reckon I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
could fix up some dishes dat would sho' make them
open their eyes."</p>

<p>"I believe there are several things that could be
done to that machine which would make her work
a lot better," Walter remarked thoughtfully. "I
would like to work on the machine firing, if necessary,
until I learned how to run her. That's the
way we will fix it. Chris can be cook, I'll be engineer,
the Captain overseer, and you, Charley,
business manager."</p>

<p>Charley forced a grin. "I'm afraid my ability
as business manager is at a discount now, but, if
you fellows care to trust me again, I believe I will
profit from the lesson I've just learned, and, with
your help, will pull our hot chestnuts out of the
fire. I believe it can be done. The first thing now
is to get back to our white elephant. Do you suppose
you can run that truck back to camp?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," said his chum doubtfully. "I
used to run a car a little at home, but it was a different
make."</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead, and see about it," Charley said.
"The Captain and Chris will help you get our
stuff aboard. I am going to make a round of the
stores and see whether Murphy owes all of them.
It is likely we will have to lay in supplies every
week."</p>

<p>Charley found his surmise correct. Every merchant
he met was clamorous to collect overdue
bills on Mr. Murphy's camp. It was here that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Charley's steady, if slow and interrupted, study of
the law stood him in good stead. "You can't collect
from us, and there's no use you're getting
mad over it," he said coolly to each infuriated merchant.
"You took a chance on Murphy, and got
stung, the same as we have, and you've got to
stand it the same as we have. If you get any of
your money back it will have to be from Murphy.
If we had been notified beforehand about your
claims against Mr. Murphy, then we would have
seen to it that the bills were settled before we paid
over the purchase price. We have not benefited
in the slightest by the things Mr. Murphy bought
of you, and you cannot expect us to pay his debts."</p>

<p>It was a frank, manly, straightforward statement,
but the merchants received it with wrath,
sore over the losses they had sustained, and treated
the lad with many threats and charges of underhandedness,
even going so far as to accuse him of
being in collusion with Murphy in an attempt to
defraud them. By the time the last merchant was
visited the lad was convinced that he could expect
no credit or sympathy in Jupiter. The knowledge
did one good thing for him, however. It
stirred up every bit of his fighting spirit, and,
when he rejoined his friends at the truck, it was
with the determination to make good on his unfortunate
venture, if it were possible for a human
being to do so.</p>

<p>Walter looked up at him with beaming face. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
can run it all right," he declared, "and it's in pretty
good shape, too, though it's been frightfully misused."</p>

<p>"Good," said his chum cheerfully, as he climbed
aboard. "Run me down to the station first. I've
got to send a telegram, and then we will go out to
camp."</p>

<p>"I've come back to ask some more questions,"
he grinned to the friendly agent. "What's the
name of a good wholesale grocery house in Jacksonville?
I want one that does not deal much
with the local merchants here."</p>

<p>"James K. Riley &amp; Co. are the best I know of,"
said the agent promptly. "Their prices are very
low, but they demand spot cash, so retail merchants
do not trade with them much."</p>

<p>Charley wrote a few lines on a telegram blank
and shoved it over to him. "Will you rush that
through for me?" he asked.</p>

<p>The agent grinned as he read the telegram:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>
"<span class="smcap">James K. Riley</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Jacksonville, Fla.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Please send at once your price list of staple groceries.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">West, Hazard, Westfield &amp; Co.</span>"<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>"Merchants here didn't exactly fold you to their
bosoms, when they learned that you were Murphy's
successor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not so you could notice it," Charley admitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with a smile. "One can't blame them much for
being sore, but, of course, we have got to look
out for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Sure," assented the agent, "you're making a
wise move at that, kid. It's a 250-mile haul from
Jacksonville here, and the freights will be high,
but, even so, you'll get your stuff 20 per cent,
cheaper than the merchants here would charge
you. The charge on this message will be a quarter."</p>

<p>Charley paid over the twenty-five cents and hurried
out to the truck, where his companions were
impatiently awaiting him. As they whirled out
on the dirt road leading to the camp he explained
to them what he had been doing.</p>

<p>"You did just right," approved the Captain.
"There can't be more than one captain to a ship,
and I reckon you have got to be captain of this
one until she sails into port or is wrecked on the
rocks. You have got more business sense than the
rest of us. I don't reckon because you made one
slip that you are going to keep on making them.
We will back you up with the last dollar we've
got in the bank, won't we, lads?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Walter heartily.</p>

<p>"Sho'," Chris agreed solemnly.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Charley simply. "I'll do my
best. Now, Walt, I wish you would show me how
to run this truck. I've got a hunch that I'm going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to have to use it a whole lot the next few months,
and now's as good a time as any to learn."</p>

<p>Fortunately the truck mechanism was very simple.
And in half an hour Charley had so far
mastered the principles of the different levers that
he felt sure that he could run it if necessity demanded.</p>

<p>"There's one thing more to do before we reach
camp," Charley said, when his lesson was finished.
"We ought to unpack our pistols and have
them handy in our pockets. I don't expect trouble,
but it is just as well to be ready for it. I
guess there are some pretty tough characters in
that bunch. I noticed, big man as he is, Murphy
had a couple of big pistols strapped on him when
he was in camp."</p>

<p>The pistols were gotten out of the pack and carefully
oiled and reloaded. They were late purchases
and looked as small and harmless as toy pistols,
but their appearance was deceiving. In reality
they were automatics of the latest make, deadly
accurate, and each, when loaded, carried 11 steel-jacketed
bullets, that could be discharged in as
many seconds. When slipped into a coat pocket
they made only a slight bulge.</p>

<p>By the time they had all pocketed their weapons
they came in full sight of the camp. Charley stood
up and viewed it with a puzzled frown on his face.</p>

<p>"Something's gone wrong," he announced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>THE STRIKE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> camp was soon plainly in view of all, and
the reason for Charley's exclamation apparent.
Although it was not nearly noon, groups of negroes
were gathered around the various tents, and
the big steam shovel lay far ahead, motionless and
deserted, with no hint of smoke trailing from its
smokestack. The only sign of activity about the
camp was the sweaty cook, once more engaged in
the seemingly endless process of molding bread
on the dirty bench outside the tent.</p>

<p>Walter stopped the car, and Charley jumped out
nimbly. None of his anxiety showed in his manner.
He strode up to the negro.</p>

<p>"Do you make bread every day?" he inquired
lightly.</p>

<p>"Sho', Cap," responded the big negro. "De niggers
want hit fresh every day."</p>

<p>"Humph," commented the lad. "If I were you,
I'd bake up enough at a time to last two or three
days. Then you would have more time to keep
things neat and clean, as they should be in a camp
of this kind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Massa Murphy nebber found no fault wid my
way ob doing things," objected the negro.</p>

<p>"Well, we are not Mr. Murphy," Charley said
curtly. "We have bought him out. We are the
owners of this thing now, and we want our food
clean. Remember that. Now, tell me, which are
Mr. Murphy's and the engineers' tents?"</p>

<p>"Right ober dar 'mongst dat little clump of
pines. De furst one is Mr. Murphy's."</p>

<p>Charley strolled over to the little tent and entered
it. It was small and dirty, and the dirt floor
was littered with whiskey bottles, all empty.
Charley viewed them with a grim smile. "No
wonder Murphy lost out," he murmured. "A man
cannot put up a good fight and entertain John
Barleycorn at the same time." There was a rude
box desk in one corner of the tent, littered with letters
and papers. Charley seated himself beside it
and overhauled its contents quickly. This done, he
walked out of the tent's squalor into the open air
once more. He next drew back the flap of the
first engineer's tent, and peeped inside, but the
tent was deserted, as was also the second, save for
disordered cots and black, greasy clothing, flung
here and there. In the third tent, however, he
found a young man, stretched out on a cot reading
a magazine. Unlike the other tents, this was neat
and cleanly, and the dirty working clothes of its
occupants were hung up on a line stretching across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the tent. "Hello," he greeted Charley boyishly.
"Back again are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Charley, as he noted the other's
self-reliant, boyish face. "I ought to have to apologize
for not ringing your bell, or knocking at your
front door, but I didn't see either."</p>

<p>"That's all right," laughed the youth, as he sat
up on the end of his cot. "Take a seat on the
other end. That's my seat of honor for my visitors."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" Charley inquired.</p>

<p>"C. P. McCarty," replied the youth, with a grin.
"I'm ashamed to confess that the C. P. stands for
Clarence Percy, but don't call me either, for I see
red when I get good and mad."</p>

<p>"One of the engineers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we get called that sometimes by courtesy.
Really, we are what you might term runners. No
one of us three is really a licensed engineer. Say,
what might your name be?"</p>

<p>"Charley West, one of the new owners of this
business."</p>

<p>McCarty threw back his head and chuckled.
"Whew!" he whistled, "just to think I've been
talking flippant to a new boss for the last ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," Charley grinned. "What I
want to know is what's the matter here? Why is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the steam shovel not running? Where are the
other two runners?"</p>

<p>"Answer to question number one and two the
same&mdash;general strike of all hands," replied McCarty
briefly. "Yesterday was pay day. We have
had no pay, any of us, for two months. Strike
came when I went on watch. I tried to stop it,
but it was no good. Can't say as I blame the niggers
much. I'm kind of sore myself. It's bad
enough living in a crowd like this, working in mud
and water, living on bum, dirty grub, and, when
you can't get your wages promptly, when you have
a family to support, it's pretty tough. As for your
third question, the other two runners have taken
the dog and gone quail hunting."</p>

<p>"I see," said Charley absently. "How long have
you been on the job?"</p>

<p>"Six months," said McCarty briefly. "I'm not
an engineer, but I've worked around machinery
ever since I can remember, and I've dug out more
dirt on this job than the other two runners put
together, if I do say it, and I could have done double
if I had had a good crew back of me."</p>

<p>"I found Mr. Murphy's payroll in his tent,"
Charley observed. "I notice that, for the past two
months, the men have been working only a little
over half the time. How does that happen?"</p>

<p>"Accidents to the machine," said McCarty laconically.
"I can't explain them, but they keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
happening right along. Strange part of it is, they
don't happen on my watch. Maybe that's just my
good luck, but I have a feeling that there's something
wrong somewhere. I don't know as there is
anything wrong going on, but I've kinder got a
hunch there is."</p>

<p>"How about the other two engineers? Are
they all right?" Charley asked.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm not going to snitch on my mates,"
said McCarty decidedly. "I may like them, or I
may not, that has nothing to do with the matter."</p>

<p>"I think it has," said Charley coolly. "You owe
a duty to your employers far above any ethical
or fancied duty to your mates, as you call them.
You are working for us, and we are the ones you
look to for your pay. I'm going to give you a
check for your wages due this afternoon. After
to-day your salary will be $100 a month, and you'll
be chief engineer or runner on the job. There are
conditions attached, of course. You are to give
me fully reports on everything pertaining to your
department; and, second, you will have to teach
my chum, Walter, how to run the machine. You
will have to look after the machine carefully, and,
as soon as a part becomes worn in the least you
must notify me, so I can have a new part ready
as soon as the old one gives out. That's my proposition.
Take it, or reject it, as you please."</p>

<p>McCarty reflected for a moment. "You're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
right," he said at last, "a man cannot serve two
masters, and I have no reason to love either of
the two engineers. They have bullied and slanged
me as much as they dared ever since I've been on
the job. It's hard to judge a dredge man, for they
are the hardest class in the world. I guess it's the
work and the men they work for that makes them
so, and, when it comes down to real meanness and
hardness, Bully Rooney and One-eye McGill stand
at the lowest of the list. I know it sounds like a
sneak, knocking his friends behind their backs, but
I don't mean to be sneakish about it. You can tell
them just what I've said. That I believe they have
caused most of the hang-ups on this job&mdash;that but
for them this job would have paid expenses, at
any rate."</p>

<p>Charley smiled. "I'm going to have a little talk
with them," he admitted, "but I am not going to
tell them anything you have said. I am grateful to
you for what you have told me, and I believe we
are going to make this thing pay. By the way,
can you tell me of any good engineer that a man
could depend upon to do the right thing?"</p>

<p>"There is Bob Bratton, of Miami," said McCarty,
brightening, "he is as white as they make
them; but," he added despairingly, "the best engineer
in the world can do but little with a poor
crew."</p>

<p>"I'm going to tend to that part of it," Charley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
said, with a smile. "You do your part, and I'll see
that the crew does theirs. Well, go ahead and
finish your story. There will be no work done on
the machine to-day. Glad to have had this little
chat with you. So-long. I'll make out your check
this afternoon."</p>

<p>He stepped out of the tent into the clear sunshine
again, strangely cheered by the fact that he
had found at least one man in the gang upon whom
he could depend.</p>

<p>At the cook tent he found Chris industriously
scraping the dirt off the bench, and vigorously
scolding the big negro, who was standing idly by,
with a look of dismay on his ebony face.</p>

<p>"I'ze plum ashamed of you," Chris was saying.
"I nebber thought dat a Bahama nigger could be
so plum nasty and dirty. I'se sho' ashamed of my
country when I see things like dis going on. Say,
what island are you from, nigger?"</p>

<p>"Eluther," said the negro sullenly.</p>

<p>"Elutheria," echoed Chris, "right next to de
Spanish Wells Island, whar you could hab learned
all manner ob things from all dose white people
what lives there. Nigger, I'se sho' ashamed ob
you."</p>

<p>Charley grinned, as he turned to the Captain,
who was facing the rest of the negroes, who had
been drawn to the spot by the loud talking. They
were a rough-looking lot of humanity, pitted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
smallpox on their faces, and their bared arms and
chests marked by old knife cuts and pistol wounds.
But they were almost giants in size, broad-shouldered,
and muscular-backed men with the narrow
hips that mark the true athlete.</p>

<p>Charley paused to choose his words before addressing
them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>LOYALTY.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Where</span> do all you boys come from?<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> I've
been pretty well over the Bahama Islands, but I
can't quite place you chaps," Charley said, smilingly.
"What island are you from, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I reckon most of us men are from Andros and
Abacco Islands. Thar's four or five from Little
Abacco or Green Turtle Key."</p>

<p>"I have never been ashore at Andros or Abacco
Island, but I know lots of fellows from Green
Turtle Key. Will those of you from Green Turtle
Key please step to one side?" Five grinning
negroes separated themselves from the crowd.</p>

<p>"I understand that you boys have quit work and
gone on a strike because your wages have not been
paid. Well, inside of two hours I will have your
checks made out, and you can go. We will not
need you any longer.</p>

<p>"Hold on, you fellows from Green Turtle Key,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>he said, as they began to move away with the
crowd. "I can't carry you all in at one trip. The
truck can't do it on a dirt road. I want you fellows
to stay over to-morrow, and I will take you
in the next day, and I want you to work cleaning
up this camp. Of course, we will pay you extra
for the work, but it must be done well. Captain
Westfield, here, will show you what we want
done."</p>

<p>The five negroes began to grumble, but the lad
silenced them with a word. "If you are in such
a hurry to go, you can walk in," he said. The
negroes were not anxious to walk in, so they gave
a grudging consent.</p>

<p>"Gee," whispered Walter, who had been listening
closely. "How can we afford to pay them?
They say there is two months' pay due them, and
that will about eat up the balance of our funds."</p>

<p>"We have simply got to pay them," Charley
grinned. "The labor alien law is strict, and they
could tie up the machine with liens and render us
helpless. Things are not quite as bad as they look.
I've been looking over Murphy's papers, and I find
that this month he had dug 10,000 yards so far.
He could not collect the money on it until the
county engineer comes out and measures it up, and
that will not be until the end of the month, so we
will get the $1,750 coming in."</p>

<p>"But look what shape we are putting ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in," said Walter anxiously. "We can't work the
machine without men."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," said Charley cheerfully.
"I'll tend to getting new and better men.
What I would like you to do is to stick right close
to McCarty and learn everything you can about the
machine. He'll be glad enough to show you. I
want you to master it, so that you will know how
every part of it works, and can let me know, so
that I can have a new part ready when the old one
gives out."</p>

<p>"Good," Walter exclaimed. "I would rather
fool around machinery than do any other work.
Say, where's McCarty's tent? I want to have a
talk with him."</p>

<p>"Wait until after dinner," Charley counseled.
"He's enjoying himself now."</p>

<p>"But what am I going to do, Charles?" protested
Captain Westfield. "I don't see where I
come in."</p>

<p>"I want you to be general overseer over the
ground men, graders, and teamsters. You see,
Captain, we want to push the work as fast as we
can, and with as few accidents as possible. I am
going to increase the men's wages, but they have
got to earn their money. Take the graders we
watched yesterday. Two good men could have
done the work those five were doing. Now, if you
will help me, we will get up our two tents a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
farther up the road. To-morrow I wish that you
would see that every tent is taken down and
scrubbed with soap and water with a good dose of
carbolic acid in it. When they are dry, have them
pitched again, not far from that little bunch of
spruce there. We will pitch our own tents among
the spruces."</p>

<p>McCarty and Walter came to their assistance,
and in a short time the two tents were pitched in
the thicket of glossy green and the dirt floors carpeted
thickly with fragrant pine needles. This
done, Charley brought over from Murphy's tent
the box with its collection of papers. The payroll
was already made out, so all the lad had to do was
to make out the checks and, as soon as it was done,
the negroes filed in, one by one, signed their names
to the pay sheet, and received their checks. Some
of them would have liked to have stayed and
worked on, but the lad was sick of their dirtiness
and laziness, and wanted no more of them.</p>

<p>Dinner followed close upon the completion of
this task, and all gathered around the long tables
upon which Chris had already impressed somewhat
of cleanliness, and had cleaned up some of
the rubbish which had littered the floor. The
grinning negroes sat down to a dinner such as they
hadn't eaten in many a day&mdash;plain and simple, but
wholesome and well flavored and well cooked.</p>

<p>They had hardly begun to eat when the engineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
entered, bearing a big bag of quail and followed
by a panting pointer dog. They sat down
quietly at the boys' table, and sullenly began to eat.
Charley noted their faces with dissatisfaction. He
knew, from what he had seen of the class, that
dredge men are a hard, cruel, overbearing class,
but these two shocked him in their sheer coarseness
and brutality of expression, and from each emanated
the strong odor of cheap whiskey. If not
drunk, they were apparently on the verge of drunkenness.</p>

<p>Charley waited until the last negro had filed out
of the tent, then he turned to McCarty. "You
might introduce me to your mates," he said, with
mild sarcasm. "They are so highly trained, socially,
that it seems that they will not speak without
an introduction."</p>

<p>McCarty grinned with delight at his new boss.</p>

<p>"This," he said lightly, "is Bully Rooney; the
one on the left is One-eyed McGill. Mr. Rooney,
Mr. McGill, meet your new boss, Mr. West."</p>

<p>"If he's the new boss, he can just understand
one thing," growled Rooney, "I'm not going to
have any greenhorn fooling around the machine
when I am working on it."</p>

<p>"Nor me, neither," growled his companion.</p>

<p>"You will not be troubled at all in that way,"
Charley assured them smilingly. "I'm going into
town in the truck between two and three o'clock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and, if you can get your things packed up, I'll take
you in. Your checks are ready, and I'll give them
to you as soon as you sign the payroll. I do not
want a man in our gang whom I cannot trust absolutely.
And I will not have one that drinks.
Drink leads to carelessness, and carelessness leads
to accidents. I imagine that's why the machine
has been broken down so much."</p>

<p>A scowl of rage showed on Rooney's face.
"That snip of a McCarty has been shooting off his
mouth too much."</p>

<p>"Murphy's papers told me all I needed to know,"
said Charley quickly, but McCarty spoke up coolly
and on his own behalf:</p>

<p>"And I've told him about the same thing, and
ought to have told him more. I should have told
him that the machine has been losing money ever
since you two came on the job. That nearly all
the dirt that has been thrown out has been thrown
out on my shift. That not a week has passed without
the machine suffering some breakdown that, in
most cases, could have been avoided. Lastly, I
could, and should have told him, that there will
not be a cent of money made on this job until
it's rid of you two skulking, booze-fighting man-killers."</p>

<p>Bully Rooney's face grew black with anger, and
he launched himself like a clumsy bear at the slight
McCarty. The youth, his Irish-blue eyes sparkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with anger, drew back his fists for a swinging blow
at the other, but Charley promptly stepped in between
the two with his little automatic in his hand.</p>

<p>"Here, that's about enough of this," he exclaimed.
"If there's any fighting to be done in
this camp hereafter, we will do it&mdash;understand
that. Now you two go to your tents and pack up
what belongs to you, for I start for town at three
prompt."</p>

<p>The two sullenly departed for their tents, muttering
angrily as they went, and Charley turned to
McCarty.</p>

<p>"I wish you would take Walter down to the machine
with you this afternoon and show him all you
can about its workings. I would also like you to
make out a list of what new parts may be needed
soon, and I will order them at once. If you know or
can think of anything that will help to make the
machine dig more dirt, I wish you would suggest
it to me, and we will go over it together. If it's
feasible, we'll adopt it at once."</p>

<p>"I can suggest two or three things, right now,"
said McCarty, eagerly. "First, our pump is all on
the bum. Its valve is all worn out. It needs repacking,
and it needs a bigger intake pipe. We
have to fill the boiler six times in twenty-four
hours, and it takes an hour each time. If it had
been tended to properly it would not take over fifteen
minutes at a time to fill up the boiler; as it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
we lose a clear five hours' work a day on that one
item alone. Then, there's the wood. It is always
piled on the left side of the track, so that we always
have to swing the machine around and wait
for the ground men to load it on, and, of course,
we do no work until they get through, which generally
takes them 15 minutes, while, if it were placed
on the other side, the machine could keep right on
while the men were loading. There's another hour
lost a day."</p>

<p>"Six hours' waste out of twenty-four," Charley
exclaimed. "Get the measurement of that valve
and intake pipe at once, and I'll get them when I
go in this time. As for the wood business, that
belongs in your department," he said, turning to
the teamster, a lanky, humorous-looking Missourian;
"what have you got to say about it?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>CHARLEY HAS A NARROW ESCAPE.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I am</span> not the boss of this outfit," said the Missourian,
with a smile. "I do what I am told to
do. Rooney and McGill ordered me to pile the
wood on that side, so I've been doing it. I reckon
Rooney and his partner figured it out that they
would get a little more rest that way. Let's have
a look at the mules, if you can spare the time."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Charley gladly. "I want to get in
touch with every part of the business as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"I always build them a corral whenever we make
a new camp," observed the Missourian, as he led
the way to the pen where he kept the mules. "Hold
on!" he shouted, as Charley stooped to pass under
the bars. "If Pansy and Violet don't just happen
to like your appearance, they are likely as not to
kick the soul out of you."</p>

<p>Charley withdrew in haste. "My, but they are
beauties for mules."</p>

<p>"Finest team I've handled," declared the teamster,
with a grin. "I kinder like to have them a
little savage with everyone. It keeps strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from fooling with them. They have life and
plenty of sense. I could not do my work with a
poor team of mules. This work is terrible on
animals."</p>

<p>"And on men, too, I guess," Charley agreed.
"I want to say that hereafter your wages will be
$2.00 per day as long as we satisfy each other.
Now, how is your work? How much wood have
you got ahead for the machine?"</p>

<p>"Not much," admitted the teamster ruefully;
"perhaps enough for a day and night, if the machine
runs like it usually does."</p>

<p>"That's not enough," Charley said decidedly.
"There should be at least a week's wood ahead all
the time. In case a mule gets sick, or goes lame,
don't you see that the machine would have to lie
up until we could get another team? It looks to
me like this dredging business is like links in a
chain. If any one man, from teamster up, fails to
do his part in the work, why, the whole machine
has got to go out of business until the defect can
be made good."</p>

<p>"I'm doing my best," the teamster protested.
"Most of my wood has to be cut and hauled over
a mile to the machine, and the route I have to take
to get to it is generally a winding one, for I have
to pass around all ponds and bog holes. It takes
careful driving to avoid bogging down your team
and losing it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then there is one weak link we have got
to strengthen right away," said the lad cheerfully.
"I will not be back from town until day after to-morrow,
but, when I come, I will bring a good
man to help you. He can do the wood chopping
while you do the hauling; meanwhile, keep on with
your work, so as to get ahead while the machine
is idle to-day and to-morrow. Another thing I
would mention is that I want to get things so systematized
that it will not be necessary to do but
little work on Sunday. I want that as a day of
rest for all hands, so far as possible."</p>

<p>The lanky Missourian reached out and grasped
Charley's hand. "I'm right with you, lad, clean up
to the hilt. You've got the right ideas. A body
of men will do as much in six days as in seven,
besides being more contented, healthy and cheerful."</p>

<p>"Well, I must get back to camp. I've got several
things to see to before I start for town,"
Charley said.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" yelled the teamster, as the boy was
turning away. "For God's sake don't move your
feet!"</p>

<p>Startled, Charley looked down. In moving forward
he had placed his right foot squarely upon
the head of a huge snake, while his left foot was
lying across the reptile's big body. It was only
by summoning all his self-control that the lad kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from jerking impulsively ahead or to one side, a
course which would surely have resulted in instant
death. In fact, death was threatening as it was.
The boy could hardly retain his position as the
powerful reptile began to twist back and forth beneath
his feet. Luckily, where he stood the
ground was soft, and the parts of the snake upon
which he stood were deeply imbedded in the soft
sand, but, even with that in his favor, it was only
a question of seconds before the repulsive reptile
wriggled free. Charley drew his automatic and
fired down at the huge, writhing, black body between
his feet. The first shot penetrated the middle
of the snake, and, firing slowly and carefully,
Charley cut roughly through the middle of the
snake's body. As its struggles grew less, the lad
leaped far ahead and looked back. The snake was
still struggling vigorously, but, with its body
nearly severed, it could do nothing but swing its
head viciously.</p>

<p>"You did that pretty neat, lad," said the teamster
cheerfully. "I was afraid you would try to
jump. You've shore got pluck."</p>

<p>Charley grinned. "It was simply a bad case of
being too scared to move. Well, let's climb on
the wagon and get back to camp. Say," he continued,
as the teamster whipped up the mules he had
harnessed up while talking, "do you have many
of those moccasins out here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not many right here," grinned the driver, "but
on these strips of pine lands there is not supposed
to be any. I suppose our crew kills from twenty
to twenty-five a week. Sometimes we kill them all
curled up nice and comfortable in our bunks. But,
pshaw! that ain't nothing to the day it will be five
or ten miles farther out. I drove out there once
and it's a sure bet the wheels and mules' hoofs
killed over a hundred going and coming."</p>

<p>"Whew!" Charley whistled, "that's not very
pleasant to hear, but, here we are at camp, and
I've been too excited over this trip to ask your
name."</p>

<p>"It's Jim Canody&mdash;'Languid Jim' they generally
call me," grinned the teamster.</p>

<p>"You can go back to work, then, Jim," said
Charley. "Do your best, and I'll have a good man
to help you soon. Drive in by the cook tent and
I'll jump off there."</p>

<p>"Well, Chris," he inquired, "how are you getting
on?"</p>

<p>The little negro grinned. "Dis ain't going to be
no cinch, Massa Charles," he said. "Cooking and
cleaning up for twenty-five men is goin' to be a
mighty big job for one small nigger. 'Sides, if you
work a night crew hit means a whole lot more
work putting up midnight lunches. Dat's a lot of
extra work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see you have got to have an assistant,"
Charley agreed.</p>

<p>"Dat's so," acquiesced Chris, "but he's going to
be mah helper, and I want to pick him out."</p>

<p>"Give me a description of the kind of help you
want, and I'll try to get it," Charley grinned.</p>

<p>Chris reflected. "I'd like a nigger jes' 'bout my
size," he said musingly. "'Cause he won't be noaccount
'less I can make him do as I tell him. I'd
like him to be a yellar nigger, too. 'Cause a yellar
negro is much more timid, and shows de dirt
much quicker dan a coal-black nigger. Hit's a lot
moah easy to keep him clean. Dis nigger don't
want no noaccount nigger trifling around dat he
can't lick."</p>

<p>Charley grinned. "I'll try to get you one like
you wish. Now, I want you to make up a list of
everything you need for the next sixty days."</p>

<p>"Golly! Massa Charles," exclaimed the little negro.
"I can't do dat, noways. I might figure out
what it would take to feed one man, but I can't
calculate on twenty-five men for sixty days. Dat's
too big figuring for one little nigger."</p>

<p>"Well, just figure on one man for thirty days,"
said Charley, amused, "and I'll figure on the other
twenty-four men."</p>

<p>"Golly," exclaimed Chris, "youah sure got a
head on you, Massa Charles. I don't see at all how's
you going to figure dat out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get out your list," said Charley, "and some time
I'll tell you how to do it. Don't put down any
fancy thing&mdash;only just what will make substantial
hearty grub, like rice, pork, beans, coffee, salt,
canned milk, sugar, flour, dried fruits, macaroni,
and, I guess, canned meats, until we get out to
the hunting ground. Hurry up, now, and get up
that list. It's time I was going now."</p>

<p>Leaving Chris to his strenuous labors of figuring
out what one man could eat in thirty days,
Charley gave a few instructions to the Captain
about cleaning up the camp, and then sauntered
over to the engineers' tent. With only a "Hello"
he threw open the flap. Bully Rooney, half-dressed,
rose up from his cot and jerked a rifle
from its slings.</p>

<p>"Better put that down," Charley advised him.
"Before you could get that thing into action I
could riddle you with my automatic." Rooney reluctantly
obeyed.</p>

<p>"Now, I didn't come in here for a row," the
lad continued. "I came in to tell you that the car
is ready for town. I'm going to leave in fifteen
minutes. Better hustle and get your things together."</p>

<p>"I ain't going," said Rooney sullenly. "I've
been working by the month, and I've got to have a
month's notice or an extra month's pay."</p>

<p>"You are going. We will not have you on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
ground&mdash;and that's pat," Charley declared. "If
you and your partner stay on, we will see that you
eat none of the company's grub. You can just stay
here and starve, for all we care. Make up your
mind quick&mdash;five minutes of that fifteen minutes
have gone."</p>

<p>"We'll go," growled Rooney, "but let me tell
you, young fellow, we will sue you as soon as we
strike town."</p>

<p>"That's good," said Charley, with cheerfulness.
"We have got nothing to lose, because you've got
no legal grounds for a suit; besides which, I don't
believe either you or McGill dare to go to court.
I really believe that neither of you dare face the
showing up of the foul things you have done on
this job. Now you both get a move on you. If
you are not ready when starting time comes I'll
leave you and bring out the sheriff to move you
when I come back."</p>

<p>Before the time arrived to go, McGill and
Rooney were stowing their hastily packed luggage
in the car, and the negroes, with their few tattered
belongings, were trying to find a place for
themselves in the crowded truck. Then, with
Charley at the wheel, the truck was headed around
for Jupiter, and they were off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>WALTER TAKES HIS FIRST LESSON IN RUNNING AN ENGINE.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I don't</span> like the idea of Charley going in alone
with that gang," Captain Westfield said uneasily.
"It's a bad crowd he's got along with him, and
they may make him trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't think they will," said Walter, as the
two stood watching the truck out of sight. "They
have all got their checks, and have got no reason
for making trouble. I guess Charley can take care
of himself. Did you see how fast he was driving
the car&mdash;almost too fast? If those engineers are
not just plain fools, they will not touch him, for,
if he let go that steering wheel for a second or
two, the car would turn turtle into the ditch and
all hands be killed or hurt."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Captain, with relief, "if that's
the case, I'll quit worrying and get out those Saws
to get down the tents that are empty."</p>

<p>"And I'll go back to the machine," Walter said.
"I want to learn all about it as soon as I can.
McCarty seems to be a mighty fine fellow, and he
is going to show me how to run it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>McCarty was waiting for him at the machine.
"Now the first lesson is going to be a dirty one,"
he said. "We will have to crawl under the car, so
you can see how each part works."</p>

<p>Shedding their coats, the two wriggled under
on the wet ground and, lying on their backs, McCarty
pointed out the various cog-wheels that
worked the car and the swinging table.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" exclaimed McCarty suddenly. "Look
at that!"</p>

<p>Startled, Walter looked to where the other was
pointing. In one of the deep, sharp niches, into
which the long teeth of the ratching descended
when the platform was in motion, was wedged a
round, yellow stick, of some eight inches in length.</p>

<p>McCarty pulled out the strange object and
looked at it musingly. He broke off a bit of it,
and, crumbling it up in his hand, examined it
closely. "That stuff must have been put in there
just before I went on duty night before last," he
said. "Gosh! It's lucky the nigger struck on me
before I started up the machine."</p>

<p>"Why?" Walter asked. "What is that stuff,
anyway?"</p>

<p>McCarty threw him the stick. "Catch it," he
said; "that's dynamite of the strongest grade."</p>

<p>Walter held the stick gingerly, as though he was
afraid it might go off at any minute.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of it," laughed McCarty. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
doesn't go off so very easy. It needs a sudden, hard
jar, or a cap and fuse, to explode it. If I had
swung that thirty-ton platform around on top of
that stuff the machine would likely have been
pretty badly smashed up, and maybe some of us
killed."</p>

<p>"Who could have put it there?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"Hard to say. Someone who wanted to put the
machine out of business, of course. To be frank,
however, it all points to Rooney, who had the shift
before mine. He blew the whistle for me when
his shift was up, and I left from the camp at once.
We passed each other about halfway, so no one
else would have had much chance to put anything
in there, between his departure from the machine
and my arrival. However, it has done no harm,
so there's no use worrying about it now, but we
had better look good, and see if there's any more
of it scattered around."</p>

<p>A close search, however, failed to reveal any
more of the dangerous explosive, so the two boys
crawled out from under the car and mounted the
swinging steel platform, where McCarty showed
the other which part of the cog-wheels they had
seen below each lever controlled. There was a
lever to move the car back and forth on its tracks
like a steam engine, a lever to put on brakes, one
to control the two-ton steel bucket, and another to
raise and lower the long steel crane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Best way for you to learn to run it is to come
on as fireman," he advised. "It's a hot, dirty job,
and long hours, but you've got to learn the steam
part first before you can become a good runner.
You've got to know enough about a steam engine
to tell if your fireman is doing his part right&mdash;to
know whether he is carrying too much or too little
steam, and whether he keeps water enough in the
boiler all the time. A careless fireman can easily
blow up a boiler and wreck his engine, so it pays
to keep an eye on your fireman."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll come on as a fireman," agreed
Walter, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"That's right," approved McCarty. "It's the
only proper way to learn. Here's another thing
to think of: Suppose you went on to that machine
to-morrow as a runner. You know now
how it works, all about the levers, etc. But, take
one example. The first thing you may have to
do is to move back on another section of track. A
section of track is only fifteen feet long, and the
part of the car that rests on it covers twelve of
the fifteen feet. The section next is butted up
against the one the car is on, but is not fastened to
it. Across the ends of the two sections the ground
men place two six-foot pieces of iron rail, to catch
the center wheels of the car. Now, everything is
ready for moving, and the ground men signal, 'Go
ahead.' You start ahead. Suddenly the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
men, who are watching cry, 'Hold, hold.' When
you have heard that cry you know the car is not
hitting that second section right. You have to stop
that machine, and stop it, not in a second, but in
a fraction of a second, or your machine will be off
the track and buried in the sand; or, perhaps, even
skidded into the ditch, and likely lost to you forever.
Do you suppose a green man, with all that
array of levers before him, could act quick enough
to save his machine and crew? Why, running a
steam locomotive is easy compared to running one
of these things. Well, I guess we have gone over
everything, and we might as well go back to camp.
In the morning we will come out and fire up and
take a few lessons in actual practice in firing and
handling some of the simpler levers."</p>

<p>"Good!" Walter exclaimed. "Say, what's that
haze off there in the west? Isn't it smoke?"</p>

<p>"Indian fires," said McCarty. "They burn off
parts of the prairies every six months so as to
get fresh pasture for their stock. Appearances
are deceptive out here. The air is so clear that
one can see objects very far distant. Now, how
far off would you say that fire is?"</p>

<p>"About ten miles off," Walter guessed.</p>

<p>"It's more than twice that far," declared the
other. "It's a queer country we will be entering
soon, and I'm thinking we'll see some queer things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
before we get through this job. But, here we are
at the camp. My, that supper smells good."</p>

<p>They found the Captain driving the negroes at
their task with all the authority an old shipmaster
can display.</p>

<p>"Gee," exclaimed McCarty, "I never saw those
niggers work like that before. Why, they've got
all the empty tents down and one of them washed
up. I wonder how he did it."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Captain can handle men, all right," said
Walter proudly. "That has been his business all
his life, handling tough crews of sailors."</p>

<p>The old skipper knocked off his men for the
night and joined the two lads. "Well, I've got a
good start for to-morrow," he said, with satisfaction.
"We'll have everything finished up by to-morrow
night. Say, those Saws ain't half-bad
workers when you handle them right."</p>

<p>"Negroes are no good out on this kind of work.
A nigger wants to be in or near a town," McCarty
declared positively. "He wants to be where he
can get out nights and 'rambles,' as he calls it.
He don't like to stay long on a job, anyway. If
he's not paid every Saturday night, he quits. If
he is paid, he's pretty likely to quit, too, for he
will have $8 or $9 in his pocket, and, as long as
he has a dollar he does not believe in work. I remember
hearing once this dialogue between a white
man and a nigger:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"White Man&mdash;'Say, boy, do you want to earn a
quarter?'</p>

<p>"Negro&mdash;'No, sah, boss; I'se dun got a quarter.'"</p>

<p>Chris beating on a tin pan drew them all to the
cook tent, where a good supper awaited them. The
sun went out of sight while they were eating, and
darkness followed immediately, as there is no twilight
in Florida. Lanterns were lit, and, while the
Captain and Walter lent the overworked little
negro a hand in cleaning up, McCarty, who had
moved his tent close to the Captain's, built up a big
fire in front of the tents, and hunted up a few
boxes for seats. Here the Captain and Walter
soon joined him, while Chris wandered over to
visit with his countrymen.</p>

<p>"I always like to sit by a camp fire evenings,
when I am out on a job like this." McCarty said.
"It seems to take away some of the loneliness, and
makes things seem more cheerful. Just listen for
a minute to the din, will you?"</p>

<p>There was no need to listen&mdash;the din could not
be ignored. The croaking of millions of frogs, the
honk of sand-hill cranes, and the screeching of
innumerable owls rose up from the darkness about
them.</p>

<p>"Sounds like they were all saying their prayers
at once and getting ready to go to sleep," said
Walter, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that's just what they are doing," said
McCarty. "Step outside of the circle of firelight
with me, and take a look around."</p>

<p>The three stepped out a few paces from the fire
and gazed about them. It was pitch dark, but all
around them glowed millions of tiny lights, flittering
here and there.</p>

<p>"Just fireflies," explained McCarty. "But watch.
See that thin white mist rising from the ground?"
As they watched, the white vapor rose higher, grew
denser, and shrouded the land with a ghost-like
shroud. The fireflies disappeared, the frogs ceased
croaking, the owls' hooting died away, and all was
still.</p>

<p>"Night has drawn its sheet over them, and they
have gone to sleep," said McCarty whimsically.</p>

<p>"Hark!" exclaimed Walter. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"Hanged if I know," said McCarty, puzzled.
"It's coming closer all the time, whatever it is."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>BOB IS SENT HOME.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was strange sounds coming out of the mists
that had drawn the lads' attention. They were
not kept long in suspense as to the nature of the
noises, for it soon became plain that they were
human voices, one shrill and piercing, the other
deep and guttural. Nearer they drew, until out
of the white vapor loomed a huge, grotesque object,
which gradually resolved itself into a big
covered wagon, drawn by four gaunt oxen. In
the front of the wagon sat an Indian woman, urging
the weary beasts on with whip and shrill cries.
Behind the wagon walked a huge, powerful Indian,
closely followed by a mass of pigs, cattle and
goats, which were urged on from the rear by a
pack of mongrel dogs, of all sizes and colors.
With much squealing of pigs, barking of dogs,
and cries from the squaw, this strange equipage
came to a stop in front of the camp.</p>

<p>The two boys advanced to the road to meet the
visitors.</p>

<p>"Hello," Walter greeted them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello," returned the Indian. "No can get by
big machine?"</p>

<p>"No," said McCarty, "I'm afraid you can't.
Machine right in road, deep ditches both sides,
plenty mud. Back one mile is a road that circles
around the machine. You understand?"</p>

<p>The Indian nodded comprehension. "No can
find road at night. Me camp here."</p>

<p>"All right," Walter assented. "When you get
unhitched, come over to camp fire and have something
to eat."</p>

<p>The two boys rummaged around in the cook
tent and got out a can of salmon, one of corned
beef, and a box of crackers, which they carried
out to the camp fire. The Indian was there awaiting
them. "She unhitch oxen," he explained.</p>

<p>Walter grinned. "Indian man no work?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"No work," agreed the Seminole.</p>

<p>"Your squaw?" asked the interested lad.</p>

<p>"No, sister," and a gleam of interest shone on
the Indian's impassive face. "You want squaw?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"No," said Walter hastily, while McCarty
laughed.</p>

<p>"Sister strong, work good, cook good, too," recommended
the Seminole seriously.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get a squaw yourself?" McCarty
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sister got tongue sharp as knife point," admitted
the Indian sadly. "She and squaw would fight
and fight and fight with their tongues, and there
would be no peace in the camp for its master."</p>

<p>Her task performed, the Indian girl now approached
the fire. She was pretty for an Indian.
Like all Seminole girls, she wore a waist of bright
colors, a skirt of calico of many hues, and beaded
moccasins on her feet. She was frankly unembarrassed
and smiled around at her hosts in evident
friendliness.</p>

<p>Walter opened the cans and handed them and
the crackers to the girl. "No meal cooked in big
tent," he explained. "To-morrow morning have
plenty hot grub."</p>

<p>The two ate silently and hungrily, and as soon
as they had finished departed for their wagon with
a brief "Good-by."</p>

<p>"They never even said thanks," McCarty commented.</p>

<p>"An Indian never expresses his gratitude in
words," Walter explained, "but they never forget
a favor done them. If we ever happen near that
fellow's camp, he will bring in some present, such
as venison or pork. Well, it is time we were turning
in. The Captain has been asleep for hours."</p>

<p>Chris awoke all hands next morning at daylight
by beating on a tin pan. He had breakfast all
ready by the time they were washed and dressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
The Seminoles had already hitched up their oxen,
and, seated by the cook tent, were patiently waiting
for the promised meal.</p>

<p>The boys invited them to seats at their own
table, and were surprised to note that they seemed
perfectly at ease, handling knife and fork.</p>

<p>The meal was quickly dispatched, and the Indians,
with a brief "good-by," departed to pick up
the road they had passed in the night, and the boys
hastened out to the machine, while the Captain,
with his negro helpers, resumed the work of cleaning
up the camp.</p>

<p>Walter quickly picked up the knack of firing,
and, after he had mastered its principles, McCarty,
standing by his side, permitted him to handle the
two levers that controlled the great steel bucket.
Simple as it looked to be when he watched
McCarty do it, Walter soon found that it required
both quickness and coolness to handle only these
two levers out of the many before him. He repeated
the operation of raising, lowering, digging,
and dumping several hundred times, gaining more
quickness, sureness, and certainty with each operation.</p>

<p>"You're going to learn quickly," McCarty said.
"I am sorry, but we can do no more to-day. If
you'll look back at your water gauge you'll see
that there are only a few inches of water left in
your boiler. Filling it is too big a job for us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
tackle alone, so you might as well rake out your
fire, and we will go back to camp."</p>

<p>"I say," he continued, as Walter threw open the
furnace door and raked out the blazing billets of
wood with an iron rake, "it's only nine o'clock.
What do you say if we go off on a little hunt for
the balance of the day? It's likely to be the last
chance we will have in many months."</p>

<p>"I'll go you," Walter agreed. "That is, provided
the Captain does not need any help."</p>

<p>They found the Captain with his task nearly completed.
"No, you can't help me any," he said.
"The niggers will have everything done by noon.
Go on and have your fun, lads, but be careful, and
be sure to get back by dark."</p>

<p>The boys sought their tents, and got out their
guns and game bags. By the time they were ready
Chris had a lunch wrapped up for them, and they
struck out into the open woods, with Bob, the dog,
gamboling in front of them.</p>

<p>"Why, you have brought your rifle along with
you," Walter exclaimed, noting his comrade's gun.</p>

<p>"Yes; one shotgun is enough," said his friend;
"and I am in hopes that we may run on to some
big game. I've seen plenty of signs of deer lately."</p>

<p>"I'll be contented if I can get a good bag of
quail."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll get them, all right," said McCarty
confidently. "The woods are full of them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Bob is as good a bird dog as there is in the State
of Florida. Look, he is at it already."</p>

<p>As if to justify the compliment paid him, Bob
had stopped in front of a little oak thicket, and
stood with head thrust forward and tail sticking
straight out. He waited patiently in this attitude
for the lads to approach.</p>

<p>"Get your gun ready, and I'll scare them up for
you," McCarty said. "If you are not used to
shooting on the wing just aim at the flock and
blaze away when they rise."</p>

<p>He picked up a heavy stick and threw it into the
thicket. With a whirling of wings a big covey of
quail rose up from its center.</p>

<p>Walter fired one barrel after the other into the
middle of the flock.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed McCarty. "You got a dozen
at least. Watch where the balance light. Here,
Bob, fetch 'em out."</p>

<p>The dog rushed forward, but stopped at the
edge of the thicket.</p>

<p>"Fetch 'em out, Bob; fetch 'em out," encouraged
the lad, but the dog turned back with drooping
tail.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong in there," declared
McCarty; "something the dog is afraid of."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going in and get my quail," Walter
said. "I'm not going to be cheated out of the
first quail I ever killed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on," said McCarty, "there's no telling
what you may run up against. The thicket isn't
over fifty feet across. Let's set fire to both sides
of it, and one of us stand by each end. We ought to
be able to kill whatever it is as it comes out."</p>

<p>"Good," Walter agreed. "I'll take my stand by
this end, and you can take yours by the other."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the thicket was ablaze on both
sides, while the two lads, with guns cocked, stood
eagerly waiting the appearance of its occupant.</p>

<p>The thicket was all of small growth, and in a
few minutes the fire had swept it clear to the
ground, leaving only here and there a few smouldering
stalks of thicket growth. The dead quail
lay scattered around on the ground, unhurt except
for a slight singing of feathers.</p>

<p>"I guess Bob got a wrong hunch that time,"
Walter said, as he picked up his quail, of which
there were thirteen.</p>

<p>"I'll bet on Bob every time," said McCarty.
"There was something in here that he was afraid
to tackle, and I'll bet if we look around long
enough we'll find some trace of it."</p>

<p>"Look out!" said Walter. "There it is, right
in front of you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>WALTER AND THE ENGINEER GO A-HUNTING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> feet in front of McCarty lay a little
mound of soft dirt, thrown up by a gopher when
digging its hole down deep into the earth. It was
the stirring of this mound of sand that had called
forth Walter's exclamation.</p>

<p>The boys watched, fascinated, as the sand trembled
more violently, and a big, flat head, with lidless
eyes, reared itself above the dirt. At sight of
the repulsive-looking head, both boys fired, and the
head dropped back, nearly severed from its body.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" exclaimed Walter, as they pried the
rest of the body from the sand with their gun
barrels. "Did you ever see one like it in your
life?"</p>

<p>"I never saw such a monster before, and I don't
believe anyone else ever did," agreed McCarty, as
he gazed down at the beautiful, diamond-marked
body of the huge rattlesnake, for such it was.</p>

<p>Walter measured the body with his gun barrel,
while McCarty counted the rattles at the tip of the
tail.</p>

<p>"It's eight feet two inches long," Walter announced.
"No one will ever believe that we killed
a rattle of that size."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, here is one way to convince them," said
McCarty, as, with his knife he severed the rattles
from the body. "They can't doubt that it was a
whopper. Here's twenty-four rattles and a button,
which shows that it was twenty-four years old."</p>

<p>"My, but I would like to get that skin off," Walter
said, longingly. "It's a beauty, but I'm afraid
to skin it."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be risky," agreed McCarty, who,
like his companion, was well versed as a hunter.
"It may have bitten itself when the fire was going
over it. But come, let's move on. The sport is
only just beginning. Did you notice where that
covey of quail settled?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Walter said, "they went down in that
bunch of spruce over there. Bob is nosing them
up already."</p>

<p>The lads followed up the sniffing dog, and out
of the rise Walter got seven more birds. "That
makes twenty," he observed. "That's enough for
supper, and there is no use killing more than we
can use. I've got some buckshot cartridges. Let's
try and find some bigger game. You've had no
fun at all, so far. I've been having it all. Which
is the best way to go?"</p>

<p>"I don't really know," said McCarty. "I have
never hunted far from camp out here, but, I fancy,
straight ahead is as good as any. I climbed way
up on the machine's boom the other day and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a good look over the country. Say, it's the craziest
looking country you ever saw. It's a regular Chinese
puzzle of stretches of prairie, ponds, bits of
flat woods, hummocks, and even little hills rising
up suddenly from the prairie. It's a queer country,
all right. Looks as though there might be any
kind of game in it. Hang it, there goes that fool,
dog again. Won't he ever learn a lesson?"</p>

<p>Bob, barking madly, had dashed into a little
thicket a few paces ahead.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" McCarty cried, as Walter started
forward with cocked gun. "Bob, Bob," he yelled.
"Come here; come here, you fool."</p>

<p>But the dog did not instantly obey. Instead,
from the thicket came the sound of a fierce struggle.</p>

<p>"What can be in there?" Walter asked anxiously.
"It sounds as though Bob was getting the
worst of it."</p>

<p>"He is, and he isn't," grinned the other. "Just
wait a minute and you will see what I mean."</p>

<p>Walter did not have long to wait. Soon a few
short barks announced that Bob had triumphed,
and a moment later the dog emerged from the
bushes, but not before a villainous odor had
reached the boys' nostrils. So strong and sickening
it was, that the lads retreated in haste.</p>

<p>"Get out of here; go home," ordered McCarty
angrily. "Go home, you fool."</p>

<p>Bob stopped and eyed him reproachfully; then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as if in obedience to an oft-repeated lesson, he
turned around and trotted back to camp.</p>

<p>McCarty chuckled as he gazed after him.
"That's Bob's one failing," he said. "He will go
out of his way to tackle a pole-cat. As soon as
the scent of one battle wears off he goes out and
seeks another. Seems like a regular mania with
him. I sure hope he will not do as he did last
time&mdash;when he went back to camp, sneaked into
my tent and went to sleep on my cot. Whew! I
had to burn my blankets and fumigate my tent before
I could sleep in it again, but I guess I had
better shut up. If we talk as we go along, we will
never get near a deer."</p>

<p>Thus far the boys had been traveling through
low, flat woods, scantily dotted with small pine
trees and little thickets of spruces and oaks, but
soon they began to enter an entirely different kind
of country. Before them stretched a vast prairie,
covered with grass and broken here and there by
rising hummocks, densely wooded with pines, oaks
and huge tropical trees. Every few hundred yards
they saw grass ponds, or little sandy-bottomed lakes
of crystal-clear water. Beside one of these little
lakes the lads stopped to eat their lunch. It was
full of fish of all sizes.</p>

<p>"I wish Chris was here," Walter observed. "He
would have the time of his life yanking out those
big fellows."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he can get all the fishing he wants right
close to camp," McCarty said. "I never saw such
a country for fish in my life. Any hole that is
deep enough to hold water is full of fish. Even
the ditches the machine has left behind are full
of little minnows already."</p>

<p>The lunch finished and washed down by
draughts of clear, cold water from the lake, the
lads began searching around its sandy shore for
deer signs. They found animal tracks in abundance,
and were amazed at the number of different
kinds&mdash;coons, wild-cats, foxes, deer, bears&mdash;all
seemed to have made the little lake their drinking
place, and, in one place, they came upon the padded
footprint of a panther.</p>

<p>"My, I wish we could put in a week hunting
around this little lake," said McCarty regretfully.
"We could make a shelter not far away and take
stands here at night. But, wishing don't accomplish
much, so I guess we might as well be pushing
on. Without a dog our only chance is to work up
against the wind and keep our eyes open."</p>

<p>They had traveled about two miles in this manner
when Walter suddenly stopped. "Look ahead,
there," he exclaimed. "Can't you see something
rising up a little above the grass?"</p>

<p>"By George, you beat me to it," McCarty acknowledged.
"It's a deer's antlers. The deer
must be lying down resting, or we would see its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
body from here. It's hands and knees for us now.
We had better keep together and make as little
noise as we can. A deer's hearing is keen."</p>

<p>It was slow, hard work, crawling forward in
this manner, but in the excitement the boys did
not notice the strain it put on hands and knees.
From time to time they would raise their heads
cautiously and peer ahead, to see if the deer was
still there. An hour and half of this slow traveling
brought them to within a few hundred yards
of the resting animal; then it suddenly arose, and
sniffed the air suspiciously, with its head thrown
back.</p>

<p>"Don't move," McCarty whispered. "It's beginning
to scent danger."</p>

<p>The boys lay quiet for several minutes; then
slowly raising their heads, took another peep. The
deer still stood broadside to them, sniffing the air.</p>

<p>"It's no use trying to get any closer," Walter
whispered softly. "It's ready to run at any minute.
Better try a crack at it with your rifle. I'll
get up on my knees and you can get a rest on my
shoulder."</p>

<p>McCarty noiselessly obeyed, and, taking careful
aim, fired.</p>

<p>"I got him," he shouted, as the deer sank to its
knees, but, even as he spoke, the deer was up again
and off like a flash. McCarty, taken unawares, had
to stop to eject the worthless shell and throw in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
a new one, by which time the deer was far away,
running in great bounds over the prairie.</p>

<p>Walter could not refrain from laughing at the
expression on the other's face. "Counted your
chickens before they were hatched," he chuckled.</p>

<p>"Oh, I got him all right!" declared his companion
confidently. "Look at the blood on the grass.
He can't run far before he drops. See, he is beginning
to falter now."</p>

<p>All the while they had been talking the boys
had been hurrying after the deer, which, although
a good mile away, was still in plain sight. Within
five minutes after McCarty spoke, it suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>"It's down," McCarty cried. "Let's hurry as
fast as we can. It's getting late, and we are a
good eight miles from camp."</p>

<p>When they reached the deer it was dead. The
bullet had passed through the body close to the
heart. McCarty produced a cord from his game
bag, and, tying its front legs to its hind ones, slung
the deer upon his back. "If you'll bring my gun,
I'll manage the deer," he said. "It's a rule of the
chase that each man shall bring in his own kill."</p>

<p>Walter slung the rifle over his shoulder. "I'll
spell you when you get tired," he offered.</p>

<p>"I am not likely to get tired. The only thing
I'm afraid of is that we are not going to be able
to make camp before dark, and, for certain reasons,
I hate to camp in this country overnight."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>THE CONVICTS' CAMP.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">McCarty</span> took the lead, and, without hesitation,
struck out due north.</p>

<p>"Why, you're going the wrong way," Walter
exclaimed, "or at least it seems the wrong way to
me. How do you know you're headed right?"</p>

<p>McCarty grinned. "I spent lots of my spare
time hunting," he explained, "and most of it was
done in a worse country than this, where one could
get lost within a couple of hundred yards of camp.
That kind of hunting develops a kind of direction
instinct, as hunters call it, but which is really a
habit of observation. Now I have taken note of
every turn we have made to-day, and, although
we are not going back the way we came, I'll guarantee
that we'll come out within a hundred yards
of camp. But I guess I had better stop bragging.
I need all my wind to handle this deer."</p>

<p>It soon became evident that McCarty was right,
and that they were not going to be able to make
camp before dark. Indeed, they had covered not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
more than three miles of the distance when darkness
descended upon them.</p>

<p>"It's a little risky, but I guess we can push on
until the white mist rises," said McCarty, as they
halted for a moment to rest. "The moon is bright
enough for us to pick our way now, but when the
mist rises we will have to make camp for the night.
I couldn't trust myself to find my way through
the fog."</p>

<p>"I don't mind a night out," Walter said, "but I
hate to have the Captain worrying about us."</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed McCarty. "But that cannot
be helped now. Let's push on again, and get
as far as we can."</p>

<p>"Well, let me take the deer for a while," Walter
urged.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind if you do, for a few minutes,"
McCarty admitted. "I've carried many a
one twice this distance, but that was in the day
time. This trying to pick trail and carry too is
sure getting my goat."</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far before McCarty
stopped again. "If I am not badly fooled, there's
a campfire right ahead of us," he said. "See that
faint glow there in the darkness."</p>

<p>"Good," Walter said. "We can perhaps camp
for the night with them, whoever they are."</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed his companion doubtfully. "If
they are Indians, it is all right, but I am suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of white men I meet in this country. We can keep
on for a ways, then one of us had better go ahead
and investigate before we walk in on them."</p>

<p>"That's my part of the job," Walter exclaimed.
"I'm a pretty fair scout, if I am not much of a
woodsman."</p>

<p>"No," contested McCarty. "I'm better used to
the kind of people we have in this part of the country
than you are."</p>

<p>"Let's not quarrel about it," laughed Walter.
"We can both go. Whoever they are, they are not
likely to hear us above the din of the frogs and
owls."</p>

<p>As the boys drew nearer to the campfire they
became silent, lest the sound of their voices should
make their presence known. When some two hundred
yards from its glow, they left the deer behind
and crept forward on hands and knees.</p>

<p>It was well that they had used such precautions,
for the appearance of the group around the campfire
was not reassuring. It consisted of three white
men and one negro. The four were sprawled
around the fire, over which a large turkey was
hung to roast, and the firelight lit up four of as
villainous looking faces as ever existed. The boys
crept close enough to distinguish their features and
hear the conversation that was going on.</p>

<p>The negro, whose face was scarred by several
knife wounds, was speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'se done getting tired ob dis," he was saying.
"I don't like dis hangin' around in de woods day
atter day adoing nothin'. What for dat white man
send us out in dese woods foah if he don't want us
to do nothin'?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," said one of his white companions
curtly. "You've got no cause to kick. If he
hadn't bribed the guard at the convict camp to let
you escape, you would be working hard gathering
turpentine yet."</p>

<p>"You ain't got no call to talk. I reckon you was
in as bad a fix as me. Worser, 'cause de guard
was just layin' foah a chance to put de whip on
youah back."</p>

<p>"You two stop fussing," said the second white
man in the group. "We are all escaped convicts,
one no better than the other. A man helped us to
escape, and sent us out here with a couple of
months' grub and instructions to wait his orders.
That suits me. I ain't anxious to go around any
town until I get new clothes and my hair grows
out, so I will not be spotted as an ex-convict. I'm
willing to do what he says and wait for his orders."</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed the fourth man. "I don't
know the boss' business, but I figure that he don't
want to use violence to stop the building of that
road unless he has to. He put Murphy out of
business pretty quick by spending a little money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with the engineers. Likely he's waiting to see if
he can't work some such trick on the new concern
before he tries any rough work."</p>

<p>"Why don't he want the road built?" inquired
one of his companions.</p>

<p>"Give it up. I reckon he's just an agent for
some big corporation," said the other. "I ain't
worrying my head about it. What I want is new
clothes and some money, and I reckon we will get
both if we do as the boss tells us to do."</p>

<p>The talk drifted round to other topics, and the
two lads crept silently back to the deer, and, shouldering
it, circled around the convicts' camp, being
careful to give it a wide berth. It was not until
they had placed a full half mile between themselves
and the convicts that they ventured to speak
aloud, and by that time the white mist had begun
to rise, and McCarty stopped near a clump of small
spruces.</p>

<p>"No use trying to go any farther," he said.
"Let's make camp here in these spruces. We can
cut some boughs and make a comfortable bed in
a few minutes."</p>

<p>The spruce thicket really made a comfortable
camping place. The dense growth of spruce shut
out the dampness, and the ground beneath them
was thickly carpeted with fragrant pine needles.
In a few minutes the boys had cut enough small
boughs to make a comfortable bed. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
too utterly weary to light a fire and cook any of
their game. They still had part of their lunch
left, and, as soon as it was eaten, they lay down
on their couch with sighs of relief.</p>

<p>"That was sure a tough-looking bunch back
there," said McCarty, as he stretched out his weary
limbs.</p>

<p>"And, judging from their conversation, they
don't mean any good to us," Walter commented.</p>

<p>"It's queer, but I've felt all the time that some
outside influence was holding back this road building,
but it was only a hunch, and I could not be
sure about it. Those fellows' talk to-night proves
my hunch was right."</p>

<p>"The agent at Jupiter hinted that the Southern
Dredging Co. might make us trouble," Walter remarked.</p>

<p>"The agent is mistaken," said McCarty, decidedly.
"I worked for that company for years, and,
while they will try to crush any company that gets
in their way, they certainly would not take the
trouble to go out of their way to crush a little concern
like ours. No, there's some other reason for
the trouble we've been having. Well, it's no use
worrying. We had better go to sleep and get what
rest we can. We will have to work to-morrow if
your chum gets back with a new crew."</p>

<p>The two weary lads were soon sound asleep,
and did not awaken until break of day. As it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
grew lighter, they were delighted to see the camp
only three miles away. McCarty had made good
his boast. He had come in a straight line from
where they had killed the deer. In an hour's time
they reached the camp, where Chris and the Captain
were overjoyed to see them back.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't shown up early this morning I
would have been out hunting for you," the old
sailor declared. "Chris and I didn't sleep much
last night."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you didn't start out," said Walter,
with a grin, "for then we would have had to turn
around and hunted you up. Chris, cut off some
venison steaks and fry them for us, please. We
are as hungry as wolves."</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over the two lads
went out to the machine and took the pump to
pieces, so as to have it ready for putting in the
new parts Charley was expected to bring back with
him. This was all they could do until he arrived
with a new crew, so they returned to the camp
and lounged around, chatting with the Captain and
Chris until they heard the truck coming in the distance,
when they went out to the road to meet it.
As it came in sight they could see that it was loaded
with men.</p>

<p>"He's got them all right," Walter exclaimed with
delight.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed McCarty, "he's sure got a load of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
them. Gosh, I hope they are the right kind. If
they are, we will soon get things running smooth
and good."</p>

<p>As the truck drew near, they could see two white
men on the seat beside Charley, while the body
of the car was filled with well-dressed men with
black eyes and hair and rather dark complexions.</p>

<p>McCarty gave a whoop of delight.</p>

<p>"Bully for your chum!" he said. "He's got
some of the best class of laborers that work in
Florida."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<small>CHARLEY GETS A NEW CREW.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span> stopped the car in front of the camp
and jumped nimbly out, followed by the two
white men, whom he introduced to the two boys as
"Bob Bratten and Will Kitchner, our new engineers."
Both were well known to McCarty, and
the three were soon busy recalling old times on
other jobs where they had worked together. But
Walter was chiefly interested in the new men who
were climbing out of the car with their suit-cases
in their hands.</p>

<p>"Gee, Charley," he whispered, "what kind of
crew is this you have brought, a bunch of tourists?"</p>

<p>"They look like it, don't they?" Charley grinned.
"But have you forgotten your manners? Can't
you say good day to them, at least?"</p>

<p>"Good day, men," said Walter pleasantly, but
his greeting was ignored, save by one of the
strange men, who had a cast in his left eye and
a humorous twist of the mouth. "Good day,
<i>señor</i>," he said, with a grin. "These men no savey
Americano. Me speak Americano plentee. Four
years this country. Work plentee on dredges."</p>

<p>"This is Bossie," Charley said, with a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
"He is going to be one of our firemen and also
interpreter." He waved his hand toward the
empty tents. "Tell the men to put their things
in them and make themselves comfortable, Bossie,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Spaniards!" exclaimed Walter. "Where in the
world did you get hold of them?"</p>

<p>"Miami," said Charley happily. "I got the pick
of four hundred of them that had just been laid
off from work by the East Coast Railway Co.
They have all had experience in this kind of work.
There are several firemen among them, and that
Bossie could even be trusted to run the machine, I
believe. They are the best class of laborers that
there is in Florida to-day. They are cleanly, hard-working,
contented and ambitious. I've got two
good engineers, too. But I must not stand here
talking. I had to leave some Spaniards in Jupiter.
I could not bring them all on one trip. I told them
I'd be right back, so I will have to go. I'll be back
with them before dinner."</p>

<p>"Shall we start up the machine?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"No, wait until I get back. There are some
things I want to talk over with all hands first.
Here are those parts for the pump. Tell McCarty
to have it fixed up this morning, so that we can
start up this afternoon. I've got lots to talk over
with you and the Captain, but that will have to
wait. So long; I'll be back in a couple of hours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Walter watched the truck out of sight with a
grin. "He sure is doing some hustling," he said
to himself.</p>

<p>Before noon, Charley was back with the second
load of Spaniards, and he also brought a yellow-skinned
negro lad of about Chris' size and age.
The Spaniards immediately made their way to the
tents where their fellow countrymen had already
unpacked and changed their fine clothes for overalls
and jumpers.</p>

<p>Charley led the little negro to the cook tent, and
lifted up the flap. "Here's your assistant, Chris,"
he said. "I hope he will give you satisfaction."
He stepped quickly outside again, but stopped
there, with a grin on his face, and beckoned to
Walter to listen to the conversation that was going
on inside.</p>

<p>"Hello, nigger," Chris was saying. "Where you
come from?"</p>

<p>"Bimini," said the other negro meekly.</p>

<p>"Dat's where dey raise de laziest niggers in de
world," Chris commented. "What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Sam Roberts," responded the cowed assistant.</p>

<p>"All right, you Sam. You get to work an' set
dem tables, 'cause dinner's going to be ready
mighty soon. After dinner I'll decide jus' what I
wants you to do each day. Get to work dar widout
no grumbling. I'se de boss in dis cook tent,
an', if you don't do like I says, I'se goin' to gib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
you a worse lickin' dan youah mammy ebber gib
you."</p>

<p>When they were called to dinner later, it was
to find the new assistant, shiny-faced from soap
and water, serving hot venison steaks and mashed
potatoes to both tables, while Chris watched him
with a critical eye.</p>

<p>The two new engineers proved to be pleasant,
healthy, vigorous, young men, and, before the
dinner was over, those at the American table had
got well acquainted with each other, while the
Spaniards at the next table chattered noisily like
a lot of magpies.</p>

<p>"I wish you would all come over to my tent,"
Charley requested, when the meal was over. "I
want to say a few words to you before we start
work."</p>

<p>When they had all collected in the little tent, the
lad spoke out frankly. "This is rather an uncertain
piece of work we are on, friends," he said;
"and it largely depends upon you whether we can
carry it through. We are pressed for time to complete
it, and we have pretty nearly reached the end
of our capital. Some unknown enemy is trying to
stop or delay the work, for some reason I do not
understand. If you will all do your best, I believe
we will pull out all right, but it's going to be close
work. Two things we must do: keep the machine
running, and beware of all strangers. Allow no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
stranger to come near the machine. McCarty has
been longest on this job, so when you are in doubt
about anything you can consult him. Now you
can fix the watches to suit yourselves and pick
your crews."</p>

<p>The question of shifts and crews was quickly
settled between the engineers, Bob Bratton taking
the first watch, from 12:00 o'clock until 8:00
o'clock at night. From 8:00 <small>P. M.</small> until 4:00 <small>A. M.</small>
would be Will Kitchner's watch, while McCarty's
trick would be from 4:00 <small>A. M.</small> until noon. This
order, they agreed, should be changed each week,
so that one man would not have to do all the night
work. Each engineer understood some Spanish,
and they soon picked out experienced firemen and
ground men from among the Spaniards. As soon
as all was settled, Bratton, with his crew, left for
the machine, and the rest dispersed, to get things
settled in their tents and to gain a little rest before
it came their turn to go on duty.</p>

<p>As soon as our little party was alone, Walter
related to the others the finding of the dynamite
under the machine, and the presence of the four
convicts in the near neighborhood.</p>

<p>"There's something big going on, but I can't imagine
what it is," Charley said gravely.</p>

<p>"I reckon this road building is interfering with
someone's plans, or they wouldn't be wanting to
stop it," Captain Westfield observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure," Walter agreed, "but who is this somebody,
and what is his plan that we are interfering
with?"</p>

<p>"I expect we will get a clew to that before long,"
Charley said thoughtfully. "As soon as they see
we are going to push things they will likely try to
stop us. They got at Murphy through his engineers,
apparently. But they can't get at us in that
way. In fact, I don't see any way they can get
at us, if we are careful and keep a sharp lookout.
We've got good engineers, and a good crew, now,
and I brought out two extra men, so as to have
plenty of help in case of sickness or accident."</p>

<p>"How about those convicts?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going in day after to-morrow for the supplies
I ordered from Jacksonville, and I'll telegraph
the sheriff about them," Charley said promptly.
"I guess he will lose no time in recapturing them.
In the meantime we will just have to watch out for
them, that's all. I guess, Walt, you'd better give
up the idea of firing&mdash;for a while, at any rate. I'll
have to spend most of my time running around,
and the Captain will be busy with the graders. It
needs someone to keep a sharp lookout for any
possible trouble or danger."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Walter cheerfully. "I'll
stay wherever you put me."</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by one
long whistle coming from the machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's got his boiler filled and is ready to start,"
Charley exclaimed. "Come on; we don't want to
miss the start." His three chums were close at his
heels, as he hurried out to the machine. Bratton
saw them coming, and waited.</p>

<p>"Thought you might like to break a bottle of
wine over her before we started," he said, with a
grin. He swung the powerful machine around
and began to dig.</p>

<p>Our little party watched with admiration the
ease and dexterity with which he handled the
heavy, panting machine. Each time the big bucket
dumped its load of mud in exactly the right spot,
as though placed there by hand.</p>

<p>They lounged around the machine the greater
part of the afternoon, watching with delight the
steady progress being made. Except for brief
stops, to take on wood and water, the bucket swung
back and forth with the regularity of clockwork.</p>

<p>All the way back to camp Charley was silent.
"Captain," he asked finally, "do you think you can
handle that grading with three men?"</p>

<p>"I reckon so," said the old sailor. "Why?"</p>

<p>"If you can, I want to put the other two men
on as night watchmen to guard the camp."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Walter. "You must be looking
for trouble."</p>

<p>"There's nothing like being prepared for it,"
Charley replied grimly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<small>LOOKING AHEAD.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as our little party got back to camp,
Charley called together the Spaniards not yet assigned
to duty, and had the Captain select the three
men he wanted for graders. Although both Walter
and Charley could speak and understand a little
Spanish, the old sailor could not speak a word of
it, and he was careful to pick out three men who
understood a few words of English. Out of the
remainder Charley selected two to go ahead of the
machine, to clear its path of trees and to dynamite
the larger stumps. Two men were assigned as
bridge builders, for at every thousand feet a gap
must be left in the road for the back water to pass
through during the rainy season. A big, strapping
fellow, over six feet tall, was named as assistant
for the teamster, and the remaining two Spaniards
were named as night guards. All but the night
guards were to go to work next morning. To each
one Charley explained that they must not permit
any strangers to come near either camp or machine.
If they saw any strangers, except Indians, they
were to report it to him at once, or, if he was not
in camp, they must report it to Walter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"That ought to protect us pretty well," he
remarked to his chums, after the Spaniards had
dispersed, chattering over the jobs that had been
assigned to them. "In the day time, the bridge
builders will guard our rear, and the right-of-way
men will be the same as scouts in front, while you
will be watching all around generally. There will
always be a crew on the machine, and the teamster
and his helpers will be of some use as scouts
in their work. That ought to prevent any chance
of our being taken by surprise."</p>

<p>"You talk as though you were preparing for
war," Walter remarked.</p>

<p>"It does sound that way," his chum admitted.
"I've got a hunch that we are going to see trouble
as soon as those convicts get word to their boss
that the machine is running again. Judging from
what has been attempted already, our mysterious
enemies will stop at nothing to accomplish their
purpose."</p>

<p>"It's like fighting in the dark," Walter commented.
"If we only knew just what we are up
against, we would know better what to expect.
This mystery business is something I don't fancy."</p>

<p>"It's up to us to solve it," said his chum; "and
I'm going to have a try at the job to-morrow. It's
comforting, anyway, to hear that machine working
so steadily. That Bratton is sure doing some digging.
Hear how regular that bucket is dumped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
I wonder what those two long and two short whistles
mean."</p>

<p>"That's the signal to move track and back up,"
said Walter, proud of his newly acquired knowledge.
"One short whistle means go ahead, three
long ones are for the teamster; four long ones are
the distress signal, and five long ones is the signal
for everyone to come to the machine."</p>

<p>"The men must all be told what that last signal
means," said Charley thoughtfully. "It may come
handy some time."</p>

<p>As night drew near, the resting crews emerged,
yawning, from their tents, and began to prepare
for their night's work. Lanterns were filled and
cleaned and working clothes donned. Chris, with
his assistant's help, filled up a large basket with
food, which, at sundown, was sent out to the workers
on the machine.</p>

<p>Supper was eaten, and all the Americans gathered
around the campfire and told stories and jokes
in its genial glow. The Spaniards built another
fire, in front of their own tents, and sang Spanish
songs to the accompaniment of a couple of mandolins,
while Chris and Sam, his new assistant, lounging
in the cook tent, talked lovingly about their
own country, the poverty-stricken Bahama Islands.</p>

<p>"This is a mighty different camp from what it
was four days ago," remarked McCarty. "There
was no music or laughing going on then. All you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
could hear was grumbling and cursing. Believe
me, I like this new order better."</p>

<p>When 8 o'clock came, Kitchner called his crew
and left for the machine, from which soon came
Bratton with his tired crew. "Digging's good," he
said, in answer to McCarty's questions. "She's
hitting a little rock, but it's soft and digs easy. I
struck one dead head, but got it out without much
trouble."</p>

<p>"What's a dead head?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"Submerged stumps or trees," McCarty explained.
"We often come upon them in our digging.
They are generally big, hard as iron, and
mean to get out. One does not see them until the
bucket hits them, and then the machine is too close
to use dynamite."</p>

<p>"Queer," the other commented.</p>

<p>"Yes," McCarty agreed. "There are forests
buried below us, I suppose. The process of building
up and tearing down goes on all the time. In
the centuries to come, likely, these trees around
us will be buried in turn, and another forest rise
above them."</p>

<p>"The Lord moves in a mysterious way His wonders
to perform," quoted the Captain reverently.</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on, Charley
had slipped away from the little circle unnoticed,
and stepped softly out into the darkness. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
not gone far before he was halted by an abrupt
challenge and a leveled rifle.</p>

<p>"It's the boss," he said, in answer to the challenge.
"Where's Gomez?"</p>

<p>"Gomez is on the other side of the camp," answered
the sentinel in Spanish. "Each of us make
a half circle of camp, meet, and turn back again.
No one can go or come unnoticed."</p>

<p>"<i>Esto bueno. Bueno nosche, hombre.</i>" (It is
good. Good night, man.)</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno nosche, señor</i>," replied the Spaniard politely,
and Charley strolled back to the fire, satisfied
that the night guards were doing their duty.</p>

<p>"Jim," he said, to the teamster, "I want to use
one of the mules to-morrow. You've got enough
wood hauled to last a couple of days. You can
keep right on chopping while I'm gone. Take
Juan out with you. He is to be your regular
helper. Now, which mule had I better take?"</p>

<p>"Going to ride?" inquired the teamster.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Waal," he said thoughtfully, "Violet will throw
you the furthest, but Pansy might kick you while
you're down."</p>

<p>"I'll take Violet," decided the lad, with a grin.
"I object to being kicked when I'm down."</p>

<p>"I'm going to take a ride ahead to-morrow," he
told his chum, when the rest had retired. "I am
in hopes that I may hit on some clew to this mystery.
At any rate I will look over the route we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
have to take, and see what we have got to encounter.
I ought to have done that before we bought
Murphy out. Well, here goes for bed. I am going
to get an early start in the morning."</p>

<p>His intentions were sincere, but he slept so
soundly that he did not awaken until the general
call for breakfast. While he was eating Chris put
up a lunch for him, and, when he was through,
Jim, the teamster, accompanied him out to the corral.
"I'll put the bridle on Violet for you," he
offered. "She sorter objects to strangers fooling
around her mouth."</p>

<p>"All right," Charley agreed, but it was with
some little secret dismay that he viewed the towering,
powerful mule, as Jim bridled it, and, throwing
a sack over its back, led it out of the corral.</p>

<p>It was too late to back out without chaffing, for
the whole camp had paused on its way to work, to
watch the proceedings.</p>

<p>"Lead it out on the grade and give me a hand
up," he ordered, and Jim meekly obeyed. Charley
placed his foot in the teamster's hand and swung
himself lightly astride of the mule, while the teamster
jumped hurriedly back.</p>

<p>"Get up," Charley said, as he gathered up the
reins. Down went the mule's head, and up and
down went its hind part, in a series of jolting, jarring
bucks.</p>

<p>"Give it the whip," howled Walter in delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>But Charley was too busy to heed advice. He
grasped desperately at the mule's mane to save
himself, but it was too short for a hand-hold, and
over the mule's head he went, to land ten feet
away in the soft sand with a thud that made his
teeth ache.</p>

<p>Slowly he picked himself up, and, rubbing the
sand out of his eyes, looked back. The mule was
nibbling placidly at a bit of grass, and behind it
the whole camp was howling with laughter.</p>

<p>"I really think," remarked the teamster critically,
"that you could do better with a saddle on."</p>

<p>"Saddle," exclaimed Charley wrathfully, "have
you got a saddle?"</p>

<p>"Got a good one over in my tent. I 'lowed you
preferred to ride bare back. Some do, you know."</p>

<p>Charley glared at him with suspicion, but the
Missourian's pale-blue eyes met his with a look of
entire innocence.</p>

<p>"I guess I could do better with a saddle," agreed
the lad dryly. "Go and get it, if you please."</p>

<p>Even with the saddle on, it was all he could do
to retain his seat as the mule bucked up and down.
But the teamster at last gave it a whack with a
stick over the hind quarters and started it off on
a run. For one fleeting second Charley glanced
back at the grinning faces behind, then he settled
down in the saddle and strove to master the vicious
brute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<small>SCOUTING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Fortunately</span> for Charley the newly-leveled
road was still so unpacked and soft that the mule
quickly tired, with its feet at every stride sinking
to the fetlocks, and, before it reached the end of
the grade, the lad had it under control. At the
end of the grade lay the heaps of soft sand and
mud the machine had lately thrown out. He must
cross the ditch in order to get around the machine
and do it before he reached the ant-like hills of
dirt. He rose in his stirrups and surveyed the
ditch ahead. It was about eight feet wide and several
feet in depth, and in many places the bottom
was nothing more than liquid mud. Picking out
a place where the bottom showed white sand, the
lad headed the mule for the ditch, and, as it hesitated
for a moment on the edge, he brought
his whip down smartly on its flank. With a snort
of rage the mule leaped forward, clearing the ditch
by a full two feet. It was a wonderful jump, and
Charley settled back in the saddle with a sigh of
relief. "You're sure some jumper, Violet," he
said.</p>

<p>Skirting the edge of the ditch until he had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the machine the lad regained the old road and
rode slowly along, examining closely the route the
machine would have to take. This was indicated
by the surveyors' stakes, pieces of lath stuck into
the ground every hundred feet. For the most part
the stakes followed the line of the old road, departing
from it only where the road turned and
twisted, and Charley was able to follow them easily.
The surveyor had done his work well. Every
hundred feet had its stake, and on each stake was
marked in blue pencil the number of the stake and
the number of feet the new road should be graded
to make it level. A full sense of the magnitude of
the task they had undertaken came upon the lad,
as he followed up the never-ending line of stakes.
Here they led through a little hummock of dense
growth, where it would be a fearful job to clear
away the timber and dynamite the stumps. Beyond
the hummock they crossed stretches of prairie
or pine barrens, or skirted the treacherously soft
edges of saw grass ponds, only to enter another
hummock beyond. Charley gave a sigh of relief
when the stakes joined the old road again.
"There's sure some bad digging in those hummocks
and around the edges of those ponds," he said to
himself, "and how easy it will be for our enemies
to tie up the machine for weeks, break us financially,
and drive us off this job, if they just do one
simple little thing that a child ought to think of. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
guess it is because the thing is so simple that they
have not thought of it."</p>

<p>The reason for the stakes following the old road
so steadily soon became apparent, for a little farther
on it entered the thickest jungle the lad had
ever seen. On both sides rose gigantic trees, matted
together by great entwining creepers, and on
each side of the road lay stagnant pools of water,
covered with nauseous-smelling green slime. Not
a sound of life came from the jungle's gloomy
depths. The only living things seemed to be the
huge, sluggish moccasins that slipped noiselessly
from the road into the pools as the mule approached.
Evidently the surveyor had decided
that the old road was the only feasible route
through the jungle.</p>

<p>Suddenly Charley ducked his head, as a whining,
singing sound, passed over him. He had heard
that whining message before, and knew it for what
it was.</p>

<p>"A rifle bullet," he ejaculated, bewildered, as
he reined in the mule and looked around. But
no powder smoke met his searching gaze, and no
report followed the bullet's whine.</p>

<p>Again it came, that menacing, whining sound,
and from a tree close beside where he sat on the
mule an inch-thick branch rattled to the ground,
cut clean from the tree by the bullet.</p>

<p>Still Charley remained motionless, not knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
which way to go, backward or forward, but the
next whining bullet decided the matter for him. It
plowed a bit of skin from the mule's flank, and
the startled animal, leaping forward, began to run.
By the time the lad got it under control they were
half a mile from where the shooting had taken
place.</p>

<p>"Whew! That was almost uncanny," the lad
muttered to himself. "No smoke, no report, nothing
but the whizzing of the bullets. It was not any
native of these parts doing that firing, that's a
cinch. The Indians and cowmen do not know that
there are such things in existence as smokeless
powder and Maxim silencers."</p>

<p>The weird jungle proved to be about two miles
across, and Charley soon, with a feeling of relief,
rode out into a pleasant, open country, dotted with
small, clear-water lakes. He now began to come
upon signs of life: cows grazing on the short, crisp
grass; hogs rooting in the soft, muddy places. He
grinned, as, turning a curve in the road, he came
suddenly upon a group of Indian maidens, bathing
in a little lake, and who, with shrill cries, bolted
for the cover of a thicket when they spied him.
Charley, with a grin on his face, kept his head
turned the other way as he rode past. Not long
after passing them he began to come upon patches
of cultivated ground, and the thatched-roofed,
open-walled dwellings of the Indians. At the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
dwelling he dismounted and fastened the mule to
a tree. The Indians from all the shelters crowded
around him with eager greetings. He was delighted
to find among the crowd many whom he
had met before in the Everglades. These were
apparently delighted to see him, and gravely made
him acquainted with the rest of the tribe, which
was composed of about one hundred braves, besides
women and children. They insisted upon his having
dinner with them. They fed and watched the
mule, and altogether made him feel that he was
among friends. For his part Charley was astonished
at the evidences of prosperity this tribe exhibited.
Their ponies, dress, and dwellings were
far superior to any other tribes that he had ever
met up with. But what astonished him most was
the patches of cultivated ground. Never before
had he seen such a wonderful growth of corn,
yams, melons, and pumpkins.</p>

<p>After a dinner of stewed venison, yams, and
melon, Charley began to ask the questions that had
brought him out on his lonely ride. The Indians
answered them readily. "Yes, they had seen white
men&mdash;strangers. There had been several out as far
as Indiantown. Sometimes they came two or three
together. Sometimes one would come alone. They
would camp for one sleep, then return to town and
be seen no more. One there was who came often&mdash;a
little man, with a beard like a spade. No, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
did not know what the strangers' business was so
far out from town. They carried guns, but seemed
to kill no game." Mr. Bower, the man who kept
the trading-post two miles farther out, might be
able to tell him more about the strangers.</p>

<p>So Charley mounted the mule again, and rode
out to the trading-post. The road led direct to the
little store hut, which was surrounded by a magnificent
grove of oranges and grape fruit. Mr.
Bowers, a fat, jovial-looking man, greeted him
cordially, but could tell him nothing more about
the strangers than he had already learned from
the Indians. One fact he did learn, however, none
of the visitors ever went beyond the trading-post.
The lad then knew the clew for which he was looking
must lie somewhere between the trading-post
and the machine.</p>

<p>"We are meeting with some opposition in our
road-building," Charley explained frankly, "and I
did not know but what it might come through you
cattle owners objecting to having your grazing
lands thrown open to new settlers."</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" exclaimed Mr. Bowers, in frank
surprise. "We have been trying to get that road
out here for years. There's only half a dozen of
us scattered between here and the big lake, and it
has been hard work forcing the county commissioners
to have the road built. Of course, we want
the road. Our oranges rot on the trees now every
season, because we are not able to haul them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
through the mud to the railroad. Our groves, with
that road opened, would be worth more than our
cattle. What if it does bring in new settlers?
They will help to make our groves and lands still
more valuable. If any one tries to hold up that
road-building we will fix him if we can get our
hands on him."</p>

<p>It was well along in the afternoon when Charley
bade the genial Mr. Bowers good-by and headed
his mule back for camp. He alighted at the Indian
camp for a moment, to examine the land,
which seemed so wonderfully fertile. On the surface
it appeared sandy and like other pine land,
but a couple of feet below the surface he came
upon a kind of soft, grayish rock. He dug out
several pieces with his knife, dropped them in his
game bag, and, remounting and waving a last farewell
to the Seminoles, he proceeded on his homeward
way.</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of dread that he rode back
through the jungle, expecting every minute to feel
the impact of a bullet. But he emerged safely on
the other side without any message from the hidden
enemies. Darkness fell soon after he left the
jungle, but he merely let slack the reins and trusted
to his animal's instinct to find the way home. Soon
he spied the lights of the machine in the distance,
and a half hour later he dismounted at the camp,
aching and sore in every muscle of his body, and
discouraged over his fruitless trip.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<small>THE FIRST BLOW.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">This</span> mystery business just seems to get thicker
and thicker," Captain Westfield remarked, when
Charley had finished relating his experience of the
day. "Smokeless powder and Maxim silencers are
no ways common out in these woods."</p>

<p>"It startled me for a minute," Charley admitted.
"No smoke, no sound&mdash;just the whine of the bullets
coming out of that frightful jungle got me for
a while. I did not know which way to go, forward
or back. I don't know whether they meant
to kill me or not, but they pretty nearly scared me
to death."</p>

<p>"Did you meet a little man with a spade-like
beard?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"No," said his chum. "Was there one here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He was on horseback, and came from the
direction of Jupiter. The bridge builders stopped
him and sent in word to me. I went out and escorted
him by the machine. He said his name was
Jones, and that he had a young orange grove out
near Indiantown."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"You did not let him go near the machine, did
you?" Charley inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"I did not," said his chum emphatically. "He
wanted to stop and chat with the engineers, but I
told him we did not permit anyone around the machine
but our own men, and he rode on."</p>

<p>"Funny," Charley observed. "I did not meet
him. He must have turned off into the woods
somewhere. I wish I had got a glimpse of him.
I have an idea that he is the boss those convicts
were talking about."</p>

<p>"He was a mild-mannered, kind of timid-looking,
little man," Walter objected. "He did not
look as though he would hurt a fly."</p>

<p>"Mild-appearing men are sometimes the worst
of all," Charley observed, as he stretched out on
his cot. "Gee! but I am tired enough for a twenty-four
hours' sleep."</p>

<p>But, tired as he was, the lad could not go to
sleep. His active brain kept turning over every
event that had occurred, in a vain search for a
clew as to who their enemies were, and what was
their purpose. That they would resort to desperate
measures, if necessary, he had not the slightest
doubt. The placing of the dynamite under the
machine, the presence of the convicts, and the shots
in the jungle, proved that. It must be a powerful
motive that would induce men to go so far. For
all his knowledge of the state and its people, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
lad could not think of anything in this wild, remote
country that would tempt men to risk the
hangman's rope.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lad raised himself on his arm again
and listened. One of the sentinels had cried
"Halt!" Then in quick succession came repeated
cries of "Halt! Halt! Halt!" and then a shot.</p>

<p>Charley leaped from his cot, calling his companions,
and, quickly lighting a lantern, found his
rifle. But, before he could pull on his shoes, the
flap of the tent was thrown open, and one of the
sentinels, white-faced and trembling, rushed in.</p>

<p>"Me killie de man! Me killie de man!" he cried
in broken English.</p>

<p>By this time both the Captain and Walter were
awake, and the three gathered around the guard,
somewhat pale themselves, for they were not the
kind that value human life lightly.</p>

<p>"Go on, and tell us all about it," commanded
Charley. "Talk Spanish."</p>

<p>The guard broke into a torrent of words. "He
had seen the man approaching in the mist. Four
times he had called to him to halt but the man kept
coming on. Then he had fired and the man had
dropped, and now he, Gomez, would be hung."</p>

<p>The chums had been pulling on their shoes and
pants as they listened to the frightened Spaniard,
and now seizing their automatics and giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
guard the lantern, they told him to lead the way to
where the man lay.</p>

<p>It was but a short way from the tents, that the
Spaniard stopped and pointed ahead. "There he
lies," he said. "I do not want to gaze on him.
May the Blessed Virgin forgive me for his death."</p>

<p>The boys, peering into the mist, could dimly see
a dark form lying on the ground ahead of them.</p>

<p>Charley snatched the lantern from the Spaniard's
shaking hand and darted ahead. A few steps
brought him to the motionless form. When the
lantern's light fell upon it, he gave a howl of laughter,
for, instead of lighting up the pale face of a
dead man, as he had expected, its rays revealed the
form of a small black bear.</p>

<p>At the sound of his laughter, Gomez timidly approached.
His delight was unbounded when he
found out that it was a bear and not a man he had
killed. The four of them picked up the bear and
carried it back to the cook tent.</p>

<p>"Where is Lavinia, Gomez?" Charley asked as
they laid the bear down near the tent. "Why did
he not come to your aid when you fired?"</p>

<p>The Spaniard shrugged his shoulders. "I have
not seen him since I shot. He is afraid maybe.
Maybe he climb up a tree."</p>

<p>But Charley did not join in the Spaniard's laugh;
instead, he picked up the lantern. "Come on," he
said shortly. "Let's see what has become of him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Already the guards had tramped a beaten track
around the camp and it was not difficult to find
where Lavinia had made his half of the circle.
Midway of it lay the Spaniard, face down on the
ground.</p>

<p>"Esto Morta (he is dead)!" cried Gomez.</p>

<p>"No," Charley said, as he felt of the man's wrist.
"He has just fainted, I guess. Give me a hand
and we will carry him into our tent. We don't
want to rouse up the whole camp and get every one
excited."</p>

<p>They bore the Spaniard into their own tent and
laid him on Charley's cot. A sprinkling of cold
water in his face, and a small drink of liquor
quickly brought the man to his senses. "What's
the matter with you?" Charley asked when the
Spaniard had emerged from his stupor.</p>

<p>"I do not know, señor," replied the guard.
"Everything go black all of a sudden. I know
nothing more&mdash;head hurts more now bad."</p>

<p>Charley examined his head. "The skin is broken
a little," he said. "I guess you must have hit it
against something when you fell. How do you feel
now? Feel able to get over to your tent and get
to bed?"</p>

<p>"I go back on guard," the man said as he staggered
to his feet. "I feel all right again pretty
soon," but as he still appeared half dazed the lad
insisted on his going to his tent. Gomez was sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
back on guard and Charley took the sick man's
place. Both the Captain and Walter offered to
take the guard duty, but Charley refused.</p>

<p>"You both have to work to-morrow," he said,
"while I will have most of the day to rest up in.
I don't feel the least bit sleepy now," and in truth
he did not. This new incident had given him fresh
food for thought. It had needed only a glance at
the wound on Lavinia's head to convince him that
it had been made by a bullet. If he had had the
slightest doubt, it would have been dispelled by the
fact that they had found the Spaniard lying face
down. Their hidden enemies were getting bold.</p>

<p>When daylight came the weary, troubled lad
drank a cup of coffee Chris had ready for him and
tumbled down on his cot for a few hours' sleep.
He was up again before noon, and after a hasty
lunch he drove the truck into Jupiter after the supplies
he had ordered from Jacksonville. He found
them waiting for him, and after loading them on
the truck, he wrote out a telegram to the sheriff
and handed it to the agent, who whistled as he read
it over. "There's a big reward offered for those
four men," he commented as he clicked off the
message with his key. "They are all four of them
desperate characters. I guess I'll wait for the sheriff's
reply;" then Charley said: "If there's a reward
in it, we might want our share. Money isn't
any too plentiful with us yet. By the way," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
continued, "do you know a little man with mild
blue eyes and a spade-like beard that goes by the
name of Jones?"</p>

<p>"I don't know him, but I see him quite often,"
said the friendly agent. "He comes and goes here
quite frequently, generally on night trains. He gets
a lot of telegrams here. Most of them come from
the state capital and New York. They are all code
messages, that I can't make head or tail of. Everyone
here in town knows him, but nobody knows his
business, which is unusual in a little town like this.
When he comes here he generally hires a horse
and spends most of his time riding out in the
woods. There, that's the reply to your message, I
guess." He scribbled rapidly on a telegraph blank
while the instrument clicked noisily. "That satisfactory?"
he asked, as he tossed the sheet to Charley
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Sure," Charley grinned, as he read:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>
"<span class="smcap">Sheriff's Office</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Palm Beach Co.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"The four escaped convicts you described are
desperate characters&mdash;$500 reward offered for the
capture of each. We'll divide reward. Too late to
come to-day. Will come out by auto to-morrow
morning and bring posse."</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Sheriff.</span>"<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>It was almost dark when Charley got back to
camp with his load, and he was thoroughly tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
out, but he felt happier in spirits than he had in
many days.</p>

<p>"We've only got one more night of suspense to
go through," he told his chums, over the campfire.
"The sheriff will be out in the morning, with his
posse, and that will dispose of the convicts, make
us $1,000 richer, and we will have peace for a
while, I hope. Has that little man, Jones, come
back yet, Walt?"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen anything of him," his chum replied.
"The convicts are still camped in the same
place. At any rate I can see the smoke of their
campfire from the machine."</p>

<p>"Good!" Charley exclaimed. "You fellows can
sit up and talk, as long as you want to&mdash;I'm going
to bed. I'm dead tired."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<small>FIGHTING THE FIRE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Midnight</span> and the silence of sleep hung over the
little camp, when suddenly there came the shriek
of the whistle from the machine, four long blasts&mdash;the
distress signal&mdash;and from their lines the guards
came running in, crying, "Fire! Fire!"</p>

<p>Our little party, awakened by the din, stopped
only to slip on their shoes, and when they emerged
from the tent it was to find the Spaniards half-dressed,
pouring out of their shelters. One glance
was all that was needed to take in the situation.
Not half a mile distant from the camp the prairie
was a mass of flames. A strong wind was blowing
from the north, and it was rapidly sweeping the
flames down upon the little camp.</p>

<p>"My!" exclaimed Walter. "It looks as though
we were goners, all right."</p>

<p>"Let's fight as long as we can, anyway," said
Charley, who was rapidly making his plans. "Captain,
get all the buckets out of the cook tent, and
set half the men to wetting down the tents; the
other half will come with me. Walt, come with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
me, also. Come on, men. Each of you bring along
a big spruce limb with you."</p>

<p>"We have got to fight fire with fire," he explained
to Walter, as he headed for the path the
guards had trod down in the grass. "Just outside
the path is the best place to start a back fire. The
path will help to keep it from working back on the
tents."</p>

<p>The two lads tore up big bunches of dry grass,
and, lighting them, ran along the half-circle path,
scattering fire as they went. The Spaniards were
quick to catch the idea, and, stationing themselves
at regular intervals along the path, with their green
spruce boughs they beat out the flames that leaped
the little path and threatened the tents. The prairie
grass was knee high, and as dry as tinder, and,
although the wind was against it, the back fire ate
its way steadily back toward the leaping flames.</p>

<p>"We have done all we can," said Charley to his
chum, as they stood watching anxiously the approach
of the flames. "It's a toss-up whether we
will win or not. If our camp goes, we are done
for, that's all. We haven't got the money to refit
again. My! that would be a wonderful sight to
enjoy if our future wasn't hanging in the balance."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a wonderful sight. The fire, now
scarcely a quarter of a mile away, was sweeping
steadily down upon them, a solid wall of flame ten
feet high licking up the dry grass with a roaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
cackle like a mighty wind in a forest, while toward
it the back fire was slowly but steadily eating its
way. The space between the two fires was as bright
as day, and in it the lads could see scores of animals,
running bewildered here and there, trapped
between the two lines of flames: deer, coons, wild-cats
and foxes ran back and forth in frantic terror.
Within twenty feet of where the boys stood a lithe
form cleared the flames of the back fire in a mighty
leap, and rushed by the tents, heedless of the presence
of human beings in its mad flight for safety.</p>

<p>"A panther," commented Charley briefly, as the
terror-stricken animal rushed by.</p>

<p>During all this time the other occupants of the
camp had not been idle. Under the Captain's directions,
his gang of Spaniards had formed a bucket
line from the ditch to the tents, and they soon had
the little dwellings dripping with water. The teamster
had got his frightened mules out of the corral
and led them to a place of safety on the grade,
and the two engineers had run the truck out on the
road beyond the line of flames. Their tasks done,
all&mdash;Americans and Spaniards&mdash;worked to get their
most valuable possessions to a place on the grade
were they would be safe. They had but little time
to work, however, for the intense heat soon drove
them back to the road, where they gathered together
and watched anxiously the meeting of the
fires. They had not long to wait. With a roar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in which was mingled the cries of the tortured animals,
the advancing wall of fire swept down on
the thin line of back fire. Our little party held
their breath and waited. If the wall of flame
leaped the dozen or so feet the back fire had eaten
away, their camp was gone. Five minutes and a
transformation had taken place. Of the mighty
conflagration nothing remained but the blacked,
smoking dirt of the prairie. The back fire had vanquished
its mighty rival. But the danger was not
yet over. The wind had swept bits of blazing grass
down among the tents, and tiny fires were springing
up in a hundred different places. These the
boys and their followers beat out with the green
branches of the spruces. It was a full half hour
before the last of them was extinguished, and they
were able to stop and rest, and take account of the
damage done. No one was seriously hurt, but all
bore marks of the conflict, in the way of burned
clothing, singed hair, and blisters, but all were too
happy over the saving of the camp to pay much
attention to these minor injuries.</p>

<p>"Whew! that was a close shave," said Walter;
"but all's well that ends well. By the way, I didn't
see anything of McCarty and his crew. I should
have thought he would have come in with his men
and given us a hand."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has had his hands full out there,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
suggested Captain Westfield. "Maybe that fire was
just set so as to draw the men off the machine."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Charley, anxiously.
"The fire drove everything else out of my
head. Let's go out and see what's the matter. The
machine isn't running."</p>

<p>As if in answer to their conversation, there came
from the machine three long blasts of the whistle,
a pause, then four long blasts.</p>

<p>"The signal for the wagon, and the distress signal,"
Walter cried.</p>

<p>The three lads went forward on the run, followed
by half a dozen curious Spaniards. The
Captain remained behind to keep an eye on the
camp.</p>

<p>The boys were half way to the machine when the
signals sounded again&mdash;three long blasts, followed
by four long blasts.</p>

<p>Panting, they reached the machine, and clambered
up on the steel platform, where the fireman and the
two ground men were grouped around McCarty,
who lay motionless, with his head in a little pool of
blood.</p>

<p>Charley dropped to his knees beside the prostrate
lad and felt for his pulse. "He is alive, all
right," he exclaimed. "We'll have to get him to
camp before we can do anything for him. Bossie,
how did this happen?"</p>

<p>"Two men climb aboard while we standing still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
looking at fire," said the excited fireman. "McCarty
no see them. I no see them. We busy watching
fire, ground men busy watching fire, too. I no see
them till there come a crack and McCarty falls.
Man hit him over the head with a gun. Other man
hit at me. I dodge. I got steam hose in my hand.
I turn steam hose on two men. It burn them,
plentee. They yell plentee. They drop guns. Run,
plentee run."</p>

<p>By the time he had finished his narrative, the
wagon had arrived, and McCarty was gently lifted
and placed in it, and the wagon headed back for
camp.</p>

<p>"Please stay by the machine, Walt," Charley requested,
as he took his seat in the wagon and pillowed
McCarty's head in his lap. "I'll send one of
the engineers to take McCarty's place as soon as I
get to camp."</p>

<p>As soon as the wagon had gone Walter took
one of the ground men's lanterns, and looked
around for the guns Bossie claimed the strange assailants
had dropped. He found both, half buried
in the soft sand beside the car. They were Savage
rifles, of the latest make, equipped with Maxim silencers.
The lad ejected one of the cartridges, and
prying out the bullet, examined the powder. It
was high-grade smokeless. He gave one of the
rifles to Bossie, much to the fireman's delight. "I
think," said the Spaniard in his quaint English, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
think this be much more better than steam." The
other rifle the lad gave to the ground man, with
instructions to keep it always with him. He was
showing them how to operate it, when Bob Bratton
arrived to take McCarty's place. Bob grinned
as he saw the Spaniards awkwardly handling their
new weapons. "They are more likely to shoot
themselves than one of the enemy," he commented,
"but I guess it will make them feel safe to have
a gun along with them."</p>

<p>"How's McCarty?" Walter asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's come too, all right," answered the
other carelessly. "He got a pretty good crack over
the head, but it didn't break the skull any. He'll
be all right in a couple of days. Meanwhile," he
added, with a sigh, "Will and I will have to work
twelve-hour shifts."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid to work nights, with all the
queer things that are going on around us?" Walter
asked curiously.</p>

<p>The other laughed frankly. "Thunder, no," he
said. "Dredge men get used to danger. It's
around them all the time. Why, kid, when we are
working in the Everglades, it is often impossible
to hire men to work in the rotten mud, and then we
have to go to the jails and convict camps to get our
labor. I've worked on jobs there that there were
no free men on the payroll but the engineers. All
the rest were men working out their fines, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
last one of them eager to crack the engineers over
the head and get away. Bosh! This job is a cinch
compared with some jobs we have all worked on."</p>

<p>The sun was rising when Walter started back to
camp. He had only gone a few steps when he
stopped and waited. From the direction of Indiantown,
a horseman was approaching the machine.
The waiting lad recognized the pony and its rider.
It was the little man whom he had escorted past
the machine a couple of days before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<small>THE CONVICTS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Walter</span> stepped back of the machine, where he
could not be seen, and watched the little man approach.
He was curious to see if Mr. Jones would
attempt to speak to the engineer after the warning
he had given him.</p>

<p>Just before he reached the machine the little man
turned off the road and rode along the other side
of the ditch. When opposite the machine, he reined
in his pony and hailed the engineer. Bratton
stopped the machine for a second. "Go on," he
shouted. "No strangers are allowed near this machine."</p>

<p>"I just want to talk to you for a minute," said
the little man.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," answered Bratton shortly. "I
don't talk with strangers when I am on duty. Go
on. Get out of the way." But the little man still
persisted. Bratton swung the machine around, and
winked at Walter, as the bucket gathered up its
huge load of mud. Like lightning the huge boom
swung around, and the avalanche of mud descended
at the pony's feet. The frightened animal leaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
forward, almost unseating its rider. Walter hurried
forward to meet the little man, as he crossed
the ditch to the graded road. "I thought I told you
the other day that we allowed no one to bother
our engineers, Mr. Jones," he said severely.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I had forgotten that," said
the little man mildly. "Really, that engineer acted
very rude. I merely wanted to ask him a simple
little question."</p>

<p>"You can address your questions to me or one
of my chums, hereafter," said Walter stiffly.</p>

<p>"I merely wanted to ask if he had chanced to
see anything of my glasses. I dropped them along
the road somewhere, and really I am quite helpless
without them."</p>

<p>"I'll inquire at the camp if anything has been
seen of them," said the lad briefly.</p>

<p>"I have ridden a long ways this morning," continued
Mr. Jones, "and I am very hungry. I wonder
if I could get a bite to eat at your camp."</p>

<p>Walter hesitated. He did not like to have the
man stop at camp, but he disliked to refuse such a
simple request, when, after all, the man might be
harmless and well-meaning.</p>

<p>"You may stay and have breakfast with us, if
you wish," he said. "I guess it is ready now." He
walked along silently by the pony's side while the
little man chattered volubly.</p>

<p>"Why, you have had a fire," the little man said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as he surveyed the flame-swept prairie and smoke-blackened
tents. "How lucky it didn't get your
camp. I suppose that would have delayed you a
lot in your work?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that," said Walter indifferently.
"I fancy it would not have taken long
to have got other tents and supplies."</p>

<p>The Spaniards and engineers were finishing their
breakfast when the two entered the tent, but Charley
and the Captain were not in sight. They came
in and took their places at the table, however, while
the little man and Walter were still eating.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Jones," said Walter. "He lost a
pair of glasses on the road, and wishes to know if
we have seen anything of them."</p>

<p>"Please describe them to me, Mr. Jones," requested
Charley, eyeing the little man closely.</p>

<p>"They were just ordinary nose-glasses, with gold
rims. They were in a hard black leather case,"
said the little man promptly.</p>

<p>"I guess these are the ones," said Charley, producing
the black leather case. "I found them."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the little man, as he fitted the
glasses on his nose.</p>

<p>"Right where the fire was started that nearly
burnt us out last night," said Charley promptly.
"The Captain and I just came from there. I think
it's up to you, Mr. Jones, to explain how they got
there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me," said the little man quickly. "How
queer! I suppose some Indian must have picked
them up on the road and dropped them again when
he started that fire. You know they are always
burning off the prairie for their cattle. Quite a
queer incident, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It is," agreed Charley dryly. "Perhaps you
can explain&mdash;&mdash;" But the lad did not finish his
sentence, for from the road came the loud tooting
of a horn, and all rushed for the tent opening,
Walter exclaiming, "It's the sheriff." The sheriff
it proved to be, and with him were a dozen active-looking
men, each carrying a rifle.</p>

<p>"I've come for those convicts," the sheriff announced.
"Can one of you show me where they
are camped?"</p>

<p>"I can," Walter volunteered. "We will have to
go on foot, but I guess we will catch them all right.
They were up about all night, so they ought to sleep
late this morning." He glanced around at Mr.
Jones, to see how that person was taking the sheriff's
arrival, but the little man was placidly picking
his teeth with a bone toothpick and smiling pleasantly
at the newcomer.</p>

<p>"All right, lead us to them," said the sheriff.
"We want to get them back in the stockade before
night, if we can."</p>

<p>Charley watched them out of sight, and then
turned to the little man. "I wish you would tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
me, Mr. Jones, what your game is," he said earnestly,
"and why you are trying to stop this road-building."</p>

<p>The little man looked at him with surprise on
his face. "I really don't understand you," he protested
mildly. "I must say this is a most extraordinary
camp. Everyone seems so suspicious and
rude. I have never encountered such treatment before."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Jones," said Charley, wearily.
"Let's forget it. I must, however, request you to
keep away from this camp hereafter."</p>

<p>"It is not likely I will come around here again,
after the treatment I have received," said the little
man stiffly, as he mounted his pony. "Good-day,
sir," and he rode off, leaving the lad with the unpleasant
feeling that he had perhaps wounded the
feelings of an entirely innocent person. Slowly the
lad turned away, and, going to his tent, flung himself
face downward on his cot. In truth his nerves
were strained almost to the breaking point by the
tension and worry he had borne since the fateful
day they had bought the machine. He felt himself
responsible for the fortunes and even the lives
of his friends and the men working for him, and
the burden was a heavy one. But nature soon asserted
itself, and the worried lad fell into a deep,
dreamless sleep, from which he did not awaken until
Chris aroused him for dinner. He found Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
at the table waiting for him. The sheriff's auto
was gone.</p>

<p>"Yes, we got the convicts, all right," Walter said,
in answer to his questions. "They were sound
asleep, just as I expected, and the sheriff's men had
the handcuffs on them before they knew what was
going on. The sheriff permitted me to question
them, but I could not get a word out of them. They
just shut up like clams. There is no doubt, though,
that it was two of them that assaulted McCarty.
Their faces and hands were badly scalded. While
they were laying for a chance to get at him, Jones
and the other two started that fire, I guess. Well,
they gave us some hard work and worry, but all's
well that ends well."</p>

<p>"We haven't come to the end yet," Charley said,
gloomily. "We have only gained a few days of
peace, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Walter looked at his chum closely. It was so
unlike Charley to give way to gloomy forebodings.
"You want to get out and have a little fun," he
said decidedly. "If you keep on brooding and worrying
over this business, you are going to break
down, and then what will become of the job? What
you want to do is to get out and forget trouble for
a couple of days and get the cobwebs out of your
brain."</p>

<p>"I guess you are right," Charley admitted, "and
I guess now is the time for both of us to take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
little vacation. There is not much likelihood of
trouble for several days. Let's get an early start
in the morning, take our guns and some grub, and
foot it out to Indiantown. Hire a couple of ponies
from the Indians, and ride out to the great lake."</p>

<p>"I'll go you," Walter cried eagerly, for he always
welcomed anything that promised excitement
or change. "It does seem a bit selfish, though, for
us to go and leave the Captain and Chris behind."</p>

<p>"They would not care to make such a trip," declared
his chum, "but we'll ask them, anyway."</p>

<p>"Go 'way, you white chillens," said Chris, when
they approached him on the subject. "How you
'spect dis nigger's going to get away? Dat Sam
can't cook none yet. 'Sides I don't want to go
trapsing 'round. I'se done found a little pond
back there a bit, whar de fish is so thick you have
to push 'em away with a stick to keep them from
all taking de bait at once."</p>

<p>They found the Captain, seated in the shade of
a pine tree, smoking his pipe and watching the
graders at work.</p>

<p>"No, lads, I don't care to go," he said, with a
smile. "I reckon I'm a heap sight more comfortable
here than I would be tramping around in the
sun. I'm getting too old to get much pleasure out
of such trips. You two go and enjoy yourselves.
I'll stay and look out for things."</p>

<p>"We'll have to move camp in a few days," Charley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
remarked, as they paused on the grade for a
few minutes to glance over the work that had been
done since they had bought out Murphy. "The
machine is getting too far from camp. It gives
the men too long a walk, and wastes a lot of time.
Well, I can't see but what everything is running
smooth now," he concluded with satisfaction.</p>

<p>And, in truth, the boys had reason to be satisfied
with the way things were going. From ahead of
the machine came the sound of axe and the sharp
report of dynamite, as the right-of-way men cleared
a path for the machine. The machine itself was
swinging back and forth with the regularity of
clockwork. Back of the machine followed the
graders, leveling off the thrown-up dirt, while behind
them came the bridge builders, constructing
bridges over the gaps left by the machine. Everywhere
was bustle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<small>THE MEDICINE MAN.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sunrise</span> found the boys well on their way to
Indiantown. By nine o'clock they were entering
the jungle where Charley had been fired at on his
previous trip. Before entering it, however, the
lads stopped and cut two long slender poles with
which to kill the moccasins basking on the road.</p>

<p>This time no rifle bullets halted their progress,
but the snakes were there, and, by the time they
had passed out of the jungle they had slaughtered
over fifty of the loathsome creatures.</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Walter, as they broke out
of the darkness of the jungle, "that's the most awful
place I was ever in. It fairly reeks with rottenness
and fever."</p>

<p>"Yes," Charley assented. "I dread putting the
machine into it, but it's got to be done. I am going
to set fire to it before the machine gets there;
that may help some. Once we get through it, we
are over the worst. There's Indiantown, about two
miles from here. Now, I figure that the motive for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the attacks on us lies somewhere between the machine
and Indiantown, for the strange white men
never go beyond the trading-post, but, for the life
of me, I can see nothing in this country that would
supply the motive, can you?"</p>

<p>"No," Walter admitted. "The land seems fertile
enough, but there is plenty of good cheap land
along the coast, right close to the railroad, so no
one would want to come way out here for land.
There is not enough timber here to offer any temptation,
and we know that Florida contains no iron,
coal, or precious minerals. I can see no motive
for any striving out here. I guess we are just
dreaming when we talk of a powerful motive out
here."</p>

<p>"It's no dream," said Charley decidedly, "unless
that fire was a dream, those convicts a dream, that
dynamite a dream, the assault on McCarty a dream,
those rifle-bullets a dream, and the whole one disagreeable
nightmare."</p>

<p>"Well, let's forget it all," urged Walter. "Remember,
this is a pleasure trip, and we want to
make the most of it."</p>

<p>This conversation brought the two lads to the
first Indian dwelling, but they found it empty, as
was the next and the next. Near the middle of the
little settlement, however, they came upon the whole
tribe, gathered around a large wigwam. Unlike
the other buildings, this one was not only thatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on top, but was also inclosed on sides and ends
with bark and palmetto leaves. In one end was
a small opening, just large enough for a man to
enter by lying flat on the ground and wriggling
through.</p>

<p>The two lads approached the silent group with
their interest thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Willie John?" Charley asked
of an Indian he knew.</p>

<p>"Chief plenty sick," said the Indian sadly. "Indians
go get paleface doctor, but paleface doctor
say medicine no good, chief must die, but medicine
man say he cure chief for two ponies. All right,
we give two ponies. Medicine man come pretty
soon to cure chief. No cure, no ponies. Understand?"</p>

<p>Charley nodded comprehensively. "Can we go
in and see the chief?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I guess so," said the Indian indifferently. "It
no matter, I guess. Chief be dead, maybe, before
medicine man comes. He have to come all the way
from Big Cypress."</p>

<p>Charley did not wait for other permission. Lying
flat on his stomach, he wriggled into the wigwam,
followed by his chum. Once inside the lads
found themselves in pitch darkness, save that in
a distant corner a feeble rushlight, set in an earthen
saucer of oil, glowed faintly. For a moment,
the lads were sorry that they had been so rash in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
entering, for the close air of the wigwam was heavy
with the sickening smell of fever. A low moaning
from one corner, however, drew them on.</p>

<p>On a bed of boughs and skins near the rushlight
lay what had been once a magnificent figure of a
warrior. The rushlight was too dim to be of much
use, so Walter lit match after match, while Charley
bent over and examined the stricken man. The
warrior was hardly more than a skeleton. The
skin was drawn tightly over protruding cheek
bones, and the black, beady eyes glowed with unearthly
brightness in their deep sockets.</p>

<p>Charley felt of the Indian's cheek. It was almost
hot enough to burn his hand. "We can do
nothing for him," he said to his chum. "He is just
skin and bones, and he cannot live long with such
a fever. We had better get out of here. He may
have something contagious. We were fools to
come in here."</p>

<p>But, before the boys could reach the opening,
the Indians outside began to wriggle in, each bearing
a rushlight in its earthen saucer of oil. "Medicine
man come," whispered Willie John, as he
passed them. "Better sit down and keep still. Indians
no like you go now. They get plenty angry
if you go."</p>

<p>The boys' curiosity overcame their prudence.
They were both anxious to witness the rites of the
medicine man and they seated themselves among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the Indians, who, after lighting their rushlights,
set them together in the middle of the wigwam
and sat down Turk fashion on either side of the
wigwam and folded their arms across their breasts.
It was a curious scene, with the dim glow of the
rushlights falling on their impassive faces and
black, beady eyes.</p>

<p>For perhaps ten minutes the silence was unbroken
save by the restless tossing and moaning
of the sick man. Then, from outside the tent came
a shrill, wailing sound, gradually getting nearer
and nearer, until the skin that covered the entrance
was pushed to one side and through the opening
wriggled a figure that made the boys' flesh creep.
Once inside the figure rose erect, and the lads could
see in the rushlights' glow that it was an old
Indian, naked save for a loin cloth. So old was he
that his face was a mass of wrinkles, and he tottered
as he walked. Around his withered neck
was a string of alligators' teeth, and from his arms
and waist and ankles hung strings of human bones.
His withered body was painted a vivid red, slashed
with streaks of bright yellow. In his right hand he
carried a wand, from which hung dozens of rattlesnake
rattles, which made a noise like the song of a
locust whenever he moved his skinny arm. In his
left hand was clutched a bag made of snake skin.</p>

<p>As this grewsome object passed by them the boys
shrank back in dread, but the old savage did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
notice them. He tottered on, and sank to the
ground beside the sick man. Then followed a scene
which the boys never forgot. Rolling on the
ground beside the sick man the old Indian began
to beat the air with his hands, uttering a low, wailing
cry, that was taken up and repeated by the
circle of Seminoles. Faster and faster the old man
beat the air, flecks of foam gathered on his lips,
and his withered face grew horribly contorted.
With his talon-like hands he began clawing at the
sick man, who was twisting and tossing on his
couch, as though with convulsions. The medicine
man paused for a moment in his wild exertions,
and, taking from his snakeskin bag a packet of
reddish powder, he scattered it over the burning
rushlights. Immediately there rose a sweet, sickening,
pungent vapor, that made the boys gasp
for breath. They would have given a good deal
to have got out in the fresh air, but they were
afraid the Indians would resent any move on their
part, and, besides, they were curious to see the end
of this weird ceremony. They had not long to
wait. The medicine man, with a sudden yell,
snatched a knife from his loin cloth and plunged it
into the sick man's arm. Into the long, shallow
cut he had made he rubbed more of the reddish powder;
then, with a long-drawn-out wail, he sank back
to the ground and his limbs and body stiffened out
as rigid as stone. Evidently this was the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the incantations, for a couple of Indians advanced,
and, picking up the stiff figure, bore it outside of
the wigwam. The two lads started to follow, but
Willie John put forth a detaining hand.</p>

<p>"Go look at chief first," he said, and they silently
obeyed.</p>

<p>The change in the sick man was amazing. They
could hardly believe their eyes. The haggard look
of pain had disappeared from his face, his skin was
moist and cool, his tossing had ceased, and he had
fallen into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>"Pale face doctor no cure chief like medicine
man," proudly said Willie John, and the wondering
lads had to admit the truth of his assertion.</p>

<p>Outside the two lads found the Indians dashing
water in the medicine man's face and trying to
bring him out of his cataleptic state.</p>

<p>"He be all right, pretty soon," Willie John assured
them. "Alway he get stiff like this when he
wrestles with the evil spirits of sickness. Now I
will go and get two ponies for you." He soon returned,
leading two ponies already saddled and bridled.
The boys mounted, and, with farewell waves
of the hand, rode out of the camp and turned into
the road leading to the great lake.</p>

<p>"What did you think of that business back
there?" Walter asked, as soon as they were out of
hearing of the little settlement.</p>

<p>"I give it up," Charley said frankly. "It's a mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
beyond me. Of course, I don't take much
stock in all that wriggling, clawing, and wailing,
but there must certainly be some wonderful curative
agent in that powder. I agree with the doctor
that the chief was dying when the medicine man
came."</p>

<p>"Well, it is not so very wonderful, after all,
when one stops to consider the matter," said Walter
reflectively. "The Seminoles are an old, old race,
so old that nobody knows how old they are. For
ages and ages they have lived in these great
swamps, and it would be strange, indeed, if the
more intelligent of them had not by this time found
some remedy for the fevers of the country."</p>

<p>"It's interesting, anyway," Charley declared.
"I'd give something to know what that powder was
made of. It would be a blessing to the fever-stricken
world."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<small>THE OLD FORT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> long after leaving Indiantown the boys
passed into a higher country, where the road wound
in and out among great towering live oaks, under
which the ground was thickly strewed with acorns.
Multitudes of gray squirrels frisked among the
branches and made the air noisy with their chattering.</p>

<p>"I'll bet this is a great game country," Charley
remarked, as they stopped to water their ponies
at the edge of a clear-running brook. "There
ought to be bear and turkeys around where there
are so many acorns. Listen! if I am not mistaken,
those are turkeys drumming now." From a point
a little to the left of the road came a hollow thumping
sound, repeated at frequent intervals. "It's turkeys,"
said Charley, with conviction. "Come on,
let's see if we can get a shot at them."</p>

<p>The two lads dismounted, and, tying their ponies
to convenient trees, took their guns and picked
their way softly toward the sound. A hundred
feet brought them to where they could look out
from the shelter of the oaks into a little glade or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
clearing a couple of acres in extent. What they
saw caused them to pause and stare in admiration
and amusement. In the center of the glade was
a bunch of some twenty turkeys. The sun, shining
down, lit up their plumage with a thousand colors,
and made of them a picture well worth remembering,
but it was the antics that they were going
through that drew a smile from the two lads.</p>

<p>The leader of the flock, a huge gobbler with ruffled
feathers and drumming wings, was going
through a sort of strutting, mincing dance, every
motion of his being closely followed by each of
the flock, moving with slow, stately dignity.</p>

<p>"Gee!" grinned Walter. "They are doing the
'turkey trot.' It costs five dollars to see that dance
in New York."</p>

<p>"The ministers say it's immoral," said Charley
laughingly, "so let's put a stop to it. Be sure to
pick out one of the younger birds. We never could
cook that gobbler tender. I'll bet he is ten years
old."</p>

<p>The lads fired almost together, and two of the
smaller turkeys sank to the ground, while the rest
of the flock rose in flight, but only to settle again
within easy gun-shot.</p>

<p>"No use killing any more," Walter said, as the
two lads emerged from behind the oaks and picked
up the dead birds.</p>

<p>"No," Charley agreed. "These will be all we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
can use. They would spoil before we got back to
camp. But say, I am tickled to see game so plentiful.
When we get the machine and camp out
here, it will make a big difference in our grub bills."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute," said Walter, as his chum
turned to retrace his steps to the road. "Doesn't it
strike you as queer&mdash;this bare space in the heart of
a great oak forest?"</p>

<p>"It is odd," admitted Charley. "I never thought
of that until you mentioned it. Let's look around
a bit."</p>

<p>The boys, up to now, had barely noticed the
clearing, all their interest being centered on the
turkeys. As they advanced into it they were surprised
to note that it was not a freak of nature,
but had been carefully cleared by hand. The indestructible
live oak stumps still bore evidence of
the axe. Wonderingly, the lads made their way
forward.</p>

<p>"Those are not live oak trees at the other end
of the clearing," declared Charley, who was looking
around with eager eyes. "Let's see what they
are."</p>

<p>A few minutes' walk brought them to the fringe
of trees that had drawn the lads' attention. Here
they paused, with an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Gee!" Charley cried, "they are orange trees,
and, from their size, they must be hundreds of years
old."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"And there's another clearing beyond this one,"
cried Walter, who had entered the fringe of trees
to pluck some of the golden fruit. "Come on, let's
have a look at it. The oranges can wait until
we come back."</p>

<p>With all of boys' healthy love of mystery and
discovery, the two lads pushed eagerly through the
fringe of orange trees and found themselves in
another but smaller clearing, in the center of which
rose up high posts, forming four sides of a square
enclosure.</p>

<p>"A stockade!" exclaimed Charley excitedly.
"Let's see what's inside. It ought to be easy to
break down one of those posts."</p>

<p>But their united efforts failed to crack any of
the posts. They were all of live oak, which successfully
resists the wear of centuries.</p>

<p>"It's no use tiring ourselves out for nothing,"
Charley said, after they had tried several of the
posts without any success. "There must be an
opening somewhere, and we have only to follow
up the posts to find it." This they did, and, rounding
the first corner of the stockade, came upon an
opening in the wall, where had evidently once hung
a strong gate. Pushing through the opening, they
stood inside of the stockade, and, pausing, gazed
around with a feeling of awe. The little enclosure
was perhaps a half acre in extent. In the middle
of it stood a small fort, cunningly constructed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
big blocks of coquina rock. Around the little fort
were grouped what had once been dwellings, but of
which nothing now remained but their upright live-oak
posts. A hole, in one side of the fort, which
likely in some past age had been closed by a massive
door, showed the enclosure to the fortress.
Passing through the hole, the boys found themselves
in a dim room, some forty feet square. The
only light was the few rays that filtered through
the loopholes, and the two lads had to pause to
accustom their eyes to the dim twilight.</p>

<p>"My, but look here!" cried Charley, as his vision
cleared.</p>

<p>Walter backed nervously toward the door, as he,
too, began to perceive the grewsome objects
grouped around them. Directly in front of them
stood a gigantic, man-like form. Gaping holes,
where the eyes should have been, stared upon them,
and one long arm pointed directly at them.</p>

<p>"Whew, that gave me a shock at first!" exclaimed
Charley, with a nervous laugh of relief.
"One does not expect to stumble upon dead men
in armor in the wilds of Florida. Look! there's
another and another and another," he continued,
pointing to the other motionless figures sprawled
in all sorts of attitudes about the room. At the
foot of a cunningly constructed stone stairway, the
suits of armor lay so close together that the boys
could hardly pick their way between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"The defenders evidently made a brave stand
here at the foot of the stairway," Charley observed.
"Let's go up and see what's in the upper
chamber."</p>

<p>With but little relish for further investigation,
Walter followed his chum as he climbed up the
stone stairs.</p>

<p>The scene in the upper chamber was but a repetition
of that below, only the floor was more thickly
strewn with the suits of mail. Charley lifted
the rust-encrusted visor of one, but let it drop hastily
as his eyes encountered the grinning skeleton
within.</p>

<p>"They were Spaniards who made this clearing and
built this fort," he explained to his chum. "It
may have been part of one of DeSoto's expeditions,
or they may have been one of the treasure-hunting
parties that were so numerous in the fifteenth century.
Likely they became disgusted with tramping
through swamps, and, when they came to this
pleasant spot, they decided to stay for a time at
least. So they, probably, made captives of many
of the Indians, and put them to work, clearing,
planting and building. But the Indians had their
revenge in the end."</p>

<p>"You can stay here as long as you want to, but
I am going to get out in the fresh air," said Walter,
shuddering as he watched a hairy rat creep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
out from one of the suits of armor. "I will wait
for you just outside the fort."</p>

<p>"All right," Charley agreed. "I'll be out in a
few minutes."</p>

<p>Left to himself, the lad searched around in the
corners for a few minutes, trying to find something
to carry away with him as a souvenir of their
strange discovery, but, finding nothing, he soon
gave up the hunt, and, gathering up his game bag
and gun, he made his way back down the stairs and
out of the fort, glad to be in the sunshine and fresh
air once more.</p>

<p>Walter was not in sight, and, after calling him
a couple of times, Charley decided that he had probably
grown tired of waiting, and had returned to
the orange trees to eat his fill, and for them the
lad hastened. But his chum was not there, and,
with a vague feeling of alarm, the lad hurried on
to where they had left their ponies, but Walter was
not there. Now thoroughly alarmed, the lad fired
off his gun four times in rapid succession, then
waited and listened, but there came no answering
report.</p>

<p>After a moment's consideration, Charley turned
around and hastened back to the ancient clearing.
He made the round outside of the stockade, and
then, entering the gate, searched the inside thoroughly,
but no sign could he find of the missing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
one. Again he fired the distress signal of four
shots, but there was no reply.</p>

<p>The thoroughly frightened lad sat down on a
block of stone, and strove to master his nervous
fears and gather together his scattered wits. The
whole thing was incomprehensible. Not fifteen
minutes had elapsed since he had parted with Walter
in the upper chamber of the fort, and now his
chum was gone. He could not have gotten lost
in the woods, for the way back to the ponies could
be followed by a child, with its plain landmarks of
orange trees and the other clearings. Besides, in
that short length of time, Walter could not have
got beyond the sound of the gun signal, to which
he would certainly have replied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<small>THE HIDDEN VOICE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few minutes Charley was almost a prey
to vague, suspicious fears, which lie hidden deep
in most of mankind. The suddenness of his chum's
disappearance, the ages-old stockade, the ancient
fort, with its grewsome occupants, all gave force
to weird imaginings; but, with an effort, the practical
lad shook off his gloomy thoughts with the
simple logic that age is no more mysterious than
youth, and that dead men are less to be feared than
live ones. But, in spite of his sound reasoning,
the worried lad could not imagine what had become
of his chum. He was not in the stockade;
he was not in either clearing; he was not among the
orange trees; he was not back with the ponies, yet
he had passed out of the fort not five minutes ahead
of himself, but at this point in his reasoning Charley
gave a start. He had found the flaw in his own
logic. He had no proof that Walter had passed
out of the fort. Affected as the lad had been by
the grewsome sights, he might have fainted before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
reaching the open air and he might well have passed
him by in the dim light without noticing him.</p>

<p>Hastily gathering some dry sticks, Charley held
them in one hand and fired the ends. As soon as
his torch was blazing good, he entered the fort, and,
holding it aloft, inspected the lower chamber. Near
the middle of the chamber he found Walter's rifle
lying on the stone floor, but a close search showed
no other trace of the missing lad. Puzzled, he
ascended to the upper chamber, but here he found
everything as he had left it, and he descended again
to the lower chamber, convinced that in it must lie
the key to the mystery, for he was certain Walter
would not have left the fort without taking his gun
with him.</p>

<p>Walking around the stone chamber, Charley held
his torch aloft and inspected the solid floor and
walls, in the vain hope of discovering some clew
to his chum's mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a frightened cry, and flung
out his arms to save himself, for something had
given way beneath his feet, and he felt himself
sinking downward. Fortunately, his instinctive action
had been so quick that his extended arms
caught on the stone floor and saved him from sinking
into the gaping black hole beneath him. Summoning
up all his strength, the lad drew himself
up out of the trap into which he had partly fallen,
and, seizing the torch he had dropped, surveyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
spot. A large stone slab was slowly lifting back
into place. In a flash, the lad grasped the situation.
The slab had been so cunningly contrived as
to appear part of the solid floor, but, when a person
stepped on one end the slab would tilt down,
sending the victim down to the depths below, and,
when his weight was removed, the slab would tilt
back into place again.</p>

<p>Charley was quick to act. Sitting down on the
floor, he placed his feet against the end of the
slab and pressed downward. The end of the stone
immediately tipped downward, exposing the dark
hole beneath, and the lad shoved his rifle across
the opening to prevent the slab from lifting back
into place. From below him came a call that sent
his heart bounding with joy: "Is that you, Charley?"
it said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Are you hurt, Walt?" replied the delighted
lad.</p>

<p>"Not much; some bruises, and a bump on my
head, that's all. But, for goodness sake, hurry and
get me out of here. The air is so foul it is making
me feel faint. Get the ropes off the ponies, and
fasten them together. I do not believe this hole is
more than fifteen feet deep. But hurry, hurry!"</p>

<p>Charley was off like a shot and back in a few
minutes with the halters from the two ponies.
Hastily knotting them together, he fastened one
end to a projecting stone in the wall, and let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
other end down to his chum, who, white-faced and
shaken, crawled up it, hand over hand.</p>

<p>Pausing only to secure their rifles and the ropes,
the two lads hurried out into the open air.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Walter, drawing long breaths of
the sweet, pure air, "I thought I was a goner that
time. I kept calling and calling after I fell, but
when you did not answer I knew that you could
not hear me. When I was sure that my voice did
not penetrate outside of the hole I gave up hope,
for I was positive that you would not find out the
secret of that slab unless you stepped upon it, and,
if you did that, there would be two of us buried
alive, instead of one. Ugh!" he concluded, with a
shudder, "I know now what fear is&mdash;genuine, blind,
unreasoning fear."</p>

<p>The boys stopped at the orange trees only long
enough to fill their game bags with the golden
fruit, and hastened on to their ponies, fearful that,
with no halters on, they might have turned back
for Indiantown, but, much to their relief, they
found the two animals browsing contentedly by the
roadside. Each slung a turkey from one side of his
saddle and a loaded game bag from the other, and,
mounting, they rode on for their goal, the great
lake. About four o'clock they rode out from a
heavy growth of timber into full view of the broad,
shining blue waters, and a few minutes later reined
in their mounts on a high, grass-covered bank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
shaded by big live oaks. Here they staked out
their ponies to browse upon the sweet, tender grass,
and, after a plunge in the cool waters of the lake,
began their preparations for the night. Walter
gathered great bunches of moss, and made soft beds
at the base of a huge live-oak tree. Charley lit a
big fire of live oak and pine, and, while it was
burning down into a bed of glowing coals, he
dressed and cut up the two turkeys, and soon had
them frying and stewing in the pan and kettle they
had brought with them. While Charley tended to
the cooking, Walter gathered armfuls of dry wood
and placed them in a circle around the oak, where
he had made the beds. Before night fell everything
was ready, and the boys sat down to a delicious
meal of fried and stewed turkey and the eatables
they had brought with them. They had eaten nothing
since morning, and, when the meal was over,
they were full enough and tired enough to be content
to lie upon the grassy bank and simply gaze
out at the glories of the sunset on the waters of the
lake. When at last the light began to fail they
watered their ponies and staked them in a fresh
place, close to where they were going to sleep. This
done, they started up the circle of fires around the
tree and stretched out on their soft moss bed with
a pleasant feeling of security, knowing that the
slow-burning live-oak wood would keep the fires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
burning all night and protect them from all snakes
and wild animals.</p>

<p>"I have been wondering why that hole was made
in that old fort," said Walter, as they lay on their
backs gazing up at the stars. "It isn't deep enough
for a well or a dungeon."</p>

<p>"Maybe it was a hiding place for their treasures,"
suggested Charley, idly.</p>

<p>"By Jove, I believe you've hit it," Walter exclaimed.
"And that reminds me that I picked up
something for a souvenir of my adventure before
I climbed out. I couldn't see what it was, for the
hole was dark and I had no matches. It was something
hard, round and heavy. I have got it in my
game bag now."</p>

<p>"Get it out and let's see what it is," said Charley,
interested.</p>

<p>Walter rummaged in his game bag and brought
out a round object, about a foot long and ten inches
in circumference.</p>

<p>"Looks like a piece of petrified wood," he said,
as he handed it over for his chum's inspection.</p>

<p>Charley took it, and, drawing near the fire, examined
it closely. "Too heavy for petrified wood,"
he commented, as he took out his knife and scraped
away at the green encrusted object. "By Jove!
Look here," he exclaimed a moment later.</p>

<p>Walter bent over and looked at the place where
his chum had been scraping. A reddish-brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
color appeared where the green crust had been removed.</p>

<p>"Is it gold?" he asked, excitedly.</p>

<p>"No," Charley replied. "It's copper. Let's
scrape the balance of this verdigris off, and see if
we can get an idea what it was intended for."</p>

<p>Laying the cylinder on the ground between them,
both boys set to scraping away the green crust,
and in a short time they had it all removed, leaving
exposed the bright metal beneath it.</p>

<p>"Looks like there was a crack running around it
near that end," Walter observed, as Charley held
the cylinder down by the fire for closer examination.</p>

<p>"There is," agreed his chum, excitedly. "I believe
the thing is hollow. That this end is nothing
but a close fitting cap. Shall I see if I can knock
it off?"</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Walter, and Charley hammered
against the end with his hunting knife. Suddenly
the end gave way and out on the ground before the
boys fell a shower of gold coins and jewelry.</p>

<p>Charley picked up one of the coins and held it
to the light. "It's a Spanish doubloon," he announced
breathlessly. "Let's count them and put
them back in the cylinder. This is almost too good
to be true."</p>

<p>The gold coins were gathered up from the
ground and counted. There proved to be a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dollars' worth altogether. Besides the coins,
there were some twenty gold rings set with gems,
but these the boys were too inexperienced to tell
the full value of. They, as well as the gold coins,
were put back into the cylinder, and it was replaced
in the game bag.</p>

<p>"I expect there are more where those came
from," Walter remarked.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said his chum, thoughtfully. "Even
what we have found would have been considered
a big amount in the days of those Spaniards. We
can look when we go back to-morrow. Meanwhile,
I am going to get me a good night's sleep. To-morrow
is going to be another hard day."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<small>CHARLEY GETS A TELEGRAM.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tired-out boys slept soundly until awakened
by the rays of the morning sun. Rising, they enjoyed
a good swim in the cool waters of the lake,
and then, stirring up the dying embers of the campfire,
they warmed up and ate what remained of
their feast of the night before. As soon as it was
finished, they saddled up their ponies, and, with
a parting look at the beautiful lake, headed back
for camp.</p>

<p>They had not gone far before the sky became
overcast, and soon there began to fall a fine, drizzling
rain, that soaked their thin clothing and chilled
their bodies. There was no shelter to get under,
so they could only ride on and take it as it came.
When they came to the place where they had
stopped the day before Walter wanted to halt and
look for more treasure, but Charley objected.</p>

<p>"Our matches are all wet, so that we cannot
make a torch," he explained, "and we could not do
much searching without a light. If there is any
more treasure in that hole there is no danger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
anyone finding it. We, ourselves, would never
have found it but for an accident. We had better
wait until we can come back with a proper outfit
of ropes, candles, etc. To tell the truth, I want
someone else along with us next time. If one of us
should get hurt in any way it would be a bad fix
for both so far away from camp. See how near I
came to joining you in that hole yesterday? Two
is not enough where there is danger of that kind.
We will bring the Captain and Chris next time."</p>

<p>Walter, still mindful of his experience in the
black hole, was not overly anxious to repeat it, and
they rode on in the drizzling rain. Before they
reached the Indian camp the rain ceased and the
sun came out again with a warmth grateful to their
chilled bodies. On reining in at the camp, they
were astonished to see the chief sitting out in the
sun in front of his wigwam. He was thin as a
skeleton, but appeared bright and cheerful. The
Indian, Willie John, who had furnished them with
the ponies, stopped them when they started to unsaddle.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, "ride ponies on to big camp.
Turn 'em loose. They come back all right."</p>

<p>The boys tried to pay him for the use of the animals,
but he refused to take any money.</p>

<p>"Young pale-faces friends. No take money from
friends," he said generously.</p>

<p>"Very well," Charley said, "but friends may give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
gifts to friends. Soon I go to town and get plenty
of red and blue and yellow cloth and much beads.
Two sleeps (nights) from now you come to big
camp and get them. They will be a gift from the
palefaces to their Seminole brother."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the Seminole, gravely. "Two
sleeps I come to big camp."</p>

<p>"There is something noble about the Seminoles,"
said Charley, as they rode on. "Now that fellow
knows the value of money, and he knows he can get
with it many things that he desires, but his code
forbids him to take it from a friend."</p>

<p>"I like them," agreed Walter emphatically.
"They are so different from our slovenly tribes of
Western Indians. They are so clean, honest, generous,
and truthful. I doubt if a white race put in
this awful country would retain so many virtues."</p>

<p>"And they have never waged an unjust war,"
Charley added. "When they fought it was to save
themselves from being crushed out of existence.
But, when they did have to fight, they fought
bravely. During the Seminole war, not so very
many miles north of here, a party of Indians encountered
a company of soldiers. The soldiers
stood their ground until the last one was killed and
the Seminoles victorious, but, after the battle was
over, not a dead soldier was scalped according to
savage custom. Not one was touched. Even
their guns and equipment were left lying where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
they had fallen. It was a silent tribute the Seminoles
paid to a brave enemy, and, to my mind, there
was something fine in the act."</p>

<p>This conversation had brought the lads to the
jungle, and they fell silent as they rode through its
gloomy depths.</p>

<p>It was after noon when they came in sight of the
machine, which they were pleased to see was still
working steadily, showing that nothing serious had
occurred during their absence. When close to it,
Charley reined in his pony and hailed the engineer.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he called. "How are they coming?"</p>

<p>Kitchner stopped the machine, and clambering
down, walked up to him. "Not so bad," he said,
in answer to the question. "But we've only got
enough carbide to run the light to-night. Have to
have some more before to-morrow night, or we
will have to quit night work."</p>

<p>Charley frowned slightly. "That carbide light
costs like fury," he said. "I brought out a big
lot of it the last time I went to town. At the rate
it has been used up, that light costs us about $5.00
a night."</p>

<p>"It is expensive," agreed Kitchner, "and that is
not the worst feature about it. It's dangerous to
use on a job like this, where the men do not understand
it. There is always some escaping gas
from the tank, which is easily set afire by a spark
from the engine or the careless lighting of a match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
close by. One of the firemen was burnt some last
night. The gas caught fire from his lantern. An
electric light would be far better, less dangerous,
and save its own cost in the long run."</p>

<p>"We'll get a dynamo and fix up an electric light,
then," said Charley. "I'll go in to-night and order
one. It will likely take several days to get it here,
so I'll bring back enough carbide with me to run
the light until it comes."</p>

<p>This settled, the boys rode on into camp, where
Charley paused long enough to wash and change
his clothes, then got out the truck and headed for
town, where he arrived in time to catch the train
for Palm Beach. He carried with him the gold
and rings they had found in the old fort, for the
boys had decided that it would be unwise to keep
the treasure at camp, and that the sooner it was
turned into money and safely deposited in the bank
the better it would be. Once at the Beach, the lad
sought out the leading jeweler in town, and showed
him the rings and coins, and asked if he thought
he could dispose of them for him.</p>

<p>The jeweler examined the rings with the greatest
interest. "Some of these rings are very valuable,"
he declared. "Just how valuable, I would not like
to say, offhand. If you care to intrust me with the
disposal of them, I will get all the money I can out
of them for you. The gold coins you will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
no trouble about. Your bank will accept them at
nearly their real value."</p>

<p>Charley quickly accepted the jeweler's offer, and
turned over the rings to him and received a receipt
in return. At the bank he had no trouble with the
gold coins, the cashier readily accepting them and
crediting the value to his account.</p>

<p>His business transacted, the lad bought a paper,
and, securing a room in a nearby hotel, stretched
out on the bed to read and rest, for he was thoroughly
tired out by the long day he had put in. He
scanned the headlines with mild interest, but at
last he came to a paragraph that he read and reread
with growing excitement. The brief item ran
as follows:</p>

<p>"Among the bills that will come up before the
legislature when it meets next month is one to give
to a wealthy New York company a grant of one
thousand acres of land, just east of Indiantown, for
the nominal sum of $1 per acre. There is but little
doubt that the bill will pass, for this land is so remote
from transportation that it is considered of
little or no value. The New York company, it is
said, intends to develop the entire tract. They certainly
seem very eager about it, for much money
and influence is being used to secure the desired
grant."</p>

<p>For a long time the lad lay back and considered
this short notice, but could see nothing in it to account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
for the many attempts to stop the road building,
for certainly a good road would be of vast
value to the development company. At last he
gave up puzzling over the matter, and turning out
his light, prepared to go to sleep; but, he had no
sooner stretched out, than there came a thumping
at his door. "Wait a minute," he called to the
knocker, as he turned on the light and slipped on
his clothes. He opened the door, and in stepped a
little, freckled-faced messenger boy.</p>

<p>"Gee, Mister," he said, "I've had a peach of a
job finding you. Been to every hotel and boarding-house
in town. Got a telegram for you. Sign right
here."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Charley, as the youth
turned to go. "There may be an answer to this."</p>

<p>Hastily tearing open the envelope, the lad read:</p>

<p>"Better get back as soon as you can. Bunch of
New York toughs or gunmen just got off train.
Met by wagons. Gone out direction of your camp.
Saw Jones talking to some of them. Bad-looking
characters."</p>

<p>There was no name signed to the message, but
the lad knew it was from the friendly agent at
Jupiter, and, turning it over, he wrote on the back.</p>

<p>"Can't get up until morning train. Many
thanks."</p>

<p>He gave the message to the boy, together with
a half dollar to pay him for his trouble, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
soon as the boy had departed, he undressed and
went again to bed, where he lay awake half the
night, worrying over the agent's message.</p>

<p>He was waiting at the sheriff's office next morning
when that officer arrived, and to him he laid
bare the whole story of their trials since he and
his chums had bought the machine.</p>

<p>The sheriff listened with deepest interest, and
when the lad concluded he said to him frankly: "I
would like best in the world, lad, to help you, but
you have no direct evidence against anyone, and I
can make no arrests without proof. I would advise
you to see a good lawyer. Maybe he will be able
to untangle this mess for you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<small>MOVING THE CAMP.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> downcast by his failure to secure the sheriff's
aid, Charley made his way to the building
where most of the lawyers of the county had their
offices. Selecting one of the offices at random, for
he knew none of the lawyers, even by reputation,
he opened the door and entered. He found himself
face to face with a bright, alert, keen-eyed
young man, who greeted him pleasantly, and invited
him to be seated. Briefly he stated his errand
and retold the tale he had told the sheriff.</p>

<p>The young lawyer listened with deepest interest,
and at the end of it exclaimed boyishly:</p>

<p>"By Jove, this is an interesting case. I wouldn't
miss a chance to handle it for a hundred dollars.
I was a detective before I was a lawyer, and the
lure of mystery always appeals to me. There is
certainly enough mystery in this case of yours to
satisfy anyone. I will have to think it over carefully,
and look up some features of it, before I can
be of any help to you. I will be busy to-day, for
I have a case coming up in Circuit Court, but to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
I will come out to your camp and look the
ground over with you. I have a little auto of my
own, and I will enjoy the trip out, even if nothing
comes of it. I have always wanted to see that back
country, and this will be a good chance to combine
business with pleasure."</p>

<p>Charley left the friendly lawyer's office feeling
more cheerful in having enlisted his aid. He
reached the station just in time to catch the train
for Jupiter, where he alighted half an hour later.
The agent was watching for him, and immediately
drew him to one side.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are in for a rough time out at
camp," he said; "that was the wickedest-looking
bunch of men I ever saw in my life. There were
twenty of them altogether. They were expected,
too, for there were wagons waiting for them a little
ways from the station, and they drove off immediately."</p>

<p>"I cannot even stop to thank you properly,"
Charley said, earnestly. "We cannot thank you
enough for what you have done for us, anyway."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the agent heartily, "I am
pleased to have been of any assistance to you. But
I will not keep you, for I know you are anxious to
see how things are at camp. So-long, and good
luck to you."</p>

<p>A minute later Charley was in the truck and driving
out on the dirt road at a dangerous rate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
speed, for before him he could see the sharp cut of
wagon tires in the soft earth.</p>

<p>About three miles from camp the wagon tracks
left the road, and, as far as the lad could see from
the car, continued at a right angle to it. Somewhat
relieved by this discovery, he reduced his
speed and drove into camp at an easy gait.</p>

<p>Much to his delight, he found everything going
on as usual, dinner cooking in the cook tent, the
machine busily digging, and the graders leveling off
close behind it. After a little chat with Chris, the
lad retired to his tent, where he rested until his
chums and the men came trooping in to dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner was eaten, Charley called a council
of war of his chums, the two engineers off duty,
and Bossie the fireman. He told them of all he
had learned during his trip. "Of course I may be
making a mountain out of a mole hill," he said, in
conclusion. "Those men may be only a party of
hunters out for a good time, but, from what we
have already met with, it will be well to be on our
guard until we are sure of the fact. We cannot
tell in what way or when we will be made to suffer.
I want every man&mdash;Spaniard as well as American&mdash;to
be constantly on the watch for any signs of
trouble. You, Bossie, explain to your countrymen
just how things stand, so that none of them will be
taken unawares. Now, have any of you any suggestions
to offer?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think we ought to move camp as soon as
possible," said McCarty promptly. "It's a good
two miles from here to the machine now, and the
distance is growing greater every day. Of course,
it does not make so much difference in the daytime,
but, with an enemy around, it makes it risky
for the men going back and forth at night."</p>

<p>"You're right," Charley agreed. "We had better
get an early start and move camp to-morrow
morning to a place about a quarter of a mile ahead
of the machine. I noticed a knoll of good, high
sloping ground there. When you go out, McCarty,
have one of the dynamiters set fire to the grass
there, so that the ground will be bare for the pitching
of our tents. We don't want to run any chance
of being burnt out."</p>

<p>"I don't think we on the machine run so very
much danger," observed Bratton; "not if we keep a
good watch out. It is all steel, and, in case of attack,
we can call the ground men aboard and keep
the platform revolving fast. No one can then climb
aboard, and the boiler and machinery will give
pretty good protection, while we can use our guns
from the platform to pretty good advantage."</p>

<p>"Good idea," approved McCarty. "I will adopt
that plan and tell Kitchner about it when I go
out."</p>

<p>"The dynamiters are a good mile and a half
ahead of the machine," Captain Westfield observed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
"I reckon it wouldn't be a bad idea to add them
to the guard around the camp until the machine
catches up with them a little."</p>

<p>"Good suggestion," Charley approved. "We will
do that."</p>

<p>"I have got an amendment to offer to the moving
plan," Walter said. "I suggest that we move camp
this afternoon. You have all apparently forgotten
that to-morrow is Sunday, and all hands need a
rest."</p>

<p>"You're right," Charley agreed promptly. "Call
in all the men except the crew on the machine, and
the bridge builders, Bossie. Get the other men in
the tents to roll out and help. Tell the bridge builders
to throw a bridge across the ditch, so that we
can cross and get by the machine with the truck
and wagon."</p>

<p>In a few minutes all was astir in the camp, men
busy packing up, others pulling down and folding
up tents, while still others piled them in the waiting
truck and wagon. Within half an hour of giving
the orders, Charley started with the first truckload,
carrying with him half of the Spaniards to pitch
the tents on the new camp-site. He found the knoll
burnt clear of grass and the ground still smoking
from the recent fire. Hastily unloading and directing
the Spaniards where to set up the tents, the
lad hurried back for another load.</p>

<p>Twenty men working with system can accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
wonders, and long before dark the moving
was finished and Chris was getting supper in the
cook tent.</p>

<p>"I don't like staking out the mules," said the
teamster, as he joined the rest at supper, "but I
can't build a corral for them until to-morrow. You
see, they keep moving around nearly all night, and
they get all tangled up in the ropes and wear the
hide off their legs trying to get free."</p>

<p>"I don't believe they will hurt themselves much
in one night," Charley assured him, "and to-morrow
all hands can turn in and build a corral for
them. How much wood have you got ahead?"</p>

<p>"Enough for a week," answered the teamster,
brightening. "That Juan is a first-class worker,
and I have been hauling steady. I've got it strung
along the road for a mile ahead of the machine."</p>

<p>As soon as it began to get dark, Charley gave a
gun to each of the two dynamiters, and gave them
instructions to join their two countrymen as guards.</p>

<p>Everyone was tired, and all retired early to
their tents. It was agreed that the machine should
stop work at midnight, and that, when her crew
came in, two of the camp guard would go out and
keep watch on it the balance of the night.</p>

<p>Charley was roused up about midnight by the
stop whistle of the machine, and a few minutes
later he heard its crew entering the camp, and the
chatter of the two guards, as they went out to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the crew's place. The lad rolled over with a sigh
of content, and dropped off to sleep again, only to
awaken again to the sharp crack of rifles. "Get
up, you fellows," he shouted to his chums. "There's
more trouble afoot."</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar," exclaimed Walter, in disgust.
"Can't we ever get a good night's sleep?"</p>

<p>"Don't look that way," said his chum grimly, as
he pulled on his clothes.</p>

<p>Outside the tent the lads found the Captain and
engineers just emerging from their shelters.</p>

<p>Along the road for a mile in front of the machine,
huge bonfires were burning.</p>

<p>"They have fired the woodpiles!" Charley exclaimed.
"Well, let 'em burn. There's more wood
where that came from. Let's make for the machine;
that's where the shooting came from."</p>

<p>A few minutes' walk brought them to the digger,
where they found the Spanish guards excited but
unhurt. They had fired the guns to let the camp
know of the fire. They were so apparently nervous,
however, that McCarty volunteered to stay
with them the balance of the night.</p>

<p>"Well, it might be worse," said Charley, as the
little party made their way back to camp. "They
have just made more work for the teamster and
woodchopper, that's all."</p>

<p>But, as they approached close to the camp, they
were met by one of the guards. "<i>Señors</i>," cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the man, his voice trembling, "there is frightful
groaning coming from the darkness behind our
picket line."</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded the teamster, who had
joined the little party.</p>

<p>"Toward the North Star, not far from our picket
line," answered the shaky sentinel.</p>

<p>"Go back to your post, <i>hombre</i>," Charley ordered.
"We'll get the lanterns and come right out
and see what it is."</p>

<p>The frightened sentinel obeyed, but he moved
so slowly that the boys overtook him before he
reached his post.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<small>EXCITING EVENTS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> before they reached the guard line, the
little party could plainly hear the groans that had
so frightened the Spanish sentinel. The sounds
came from a point some two hundred feet beyond
the line. Between the spells of groaning would
come noises like a struggle going on, a heavy fall,
then more groans.</p>

<p>Suddenly the teamster with an oath broke into
a run and the boys followed close at his heels. It
was a pitiful scene that the lanterns revealed when
they reached the spot. The teamster, with tears in
his eyes, was swearing vigorously as he untangled
the hitching ropes from the legs of the two mules
whose sufferings were frightful to behold. Their
bellies were swollen up to twice their natural size
and their eyes were glassy with pain. Occasionally
one would stagger to its feet, stand swaying for a
few minutes, then fall heavily to the ground, where
it would lay groaning in spasms of pain.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with them?" Charley demanded
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Lord only knows," said the teamster, "that
swelling of the stomach looks as though they had
been foundered, but that can't be. I only gave
them their usual feed for the night&mdash;just what they
always have."</p>

<p>"Can we do anything for them?" inquired the
lad.</p>

<p>Canady shook his head. "I am afraid they are
too far gone," he said. "But I'll try. I've got all
kinds of medicines in my tent. I'll run and get
them."</p>

<p>He was back in a minute with a box full of pint
bottles. Then followed hours of anxious labor,
holding and dosing the sick animals, but it was all
in vain. Before daylight one mule stiffened out in
death and a half hour later the other one died.</p>

<p>It was a sorrowful little party that stood around
the dead animals. To the little party of chums it
meant the loss of $500 and the tying up of the machine
until a new team could be procured. To the
teamster it meant the loss of two animals to which
he had really grown attached.</p>

<p>"This was no accident," declared the Captain,
as they stood around discussing the affair. "It
comes right at the time the wood piles were fired.
That ain't no coincident, I reckon."</p>

<p>"You're right," Charley agreed. "Their aim
was to tie up the machine by cutting off our wood
supply, and it looks as though they have succeeded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
No doubt the mules were poisoned, but the thing
that puzzles me is how the poison was administered.
Mules are the most particular animals in
the world about what they take into their mouths."</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at the feed boxes," Walter
suggested; "there ought to be some clews in them."</p>

<p>The teamster uttered an oath as he held his lantern
over the feed boxes, for each was still partly
filled with wheat. "That's what done it," he swore
savagely. "All animals love the taste of wheat, but
it is sure death to them if they eat any quantity of
it. It swells so fast in their stomachs. Lord, I
wish I had hold of the fellow who did this
thing."</p>

<p>"Bring your lanterns," called Walter, who had
stepped away a few paces from the crowd. "There's
something lying here on the ground. I believe it's
a man."</p>

<p>In a second his companions were by his side with
their lanterns. As the lights flashed down on the
prostrate object, an exclamation of horror burst
out from the little party, for, lying on his back, his
head in a pool of blood, lay a man, one side of his
skull entirely crushed in.</p>

<p>"He's the one that fixed the mules," declared the
teamster excitedly. "One of the mules killed him.
Serves him right. I'm glad he got his."</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Charley shortly. "This is too
horrible a thing to exult over. Come on, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
you, and give me a hand to carry him to my tent.
We cannot leave him lying here."</p>

<p>Silently the little party lifted the dead man and
bore him into the lad's tent and laid him down on a
cot. Charley got water and a cloth and washed
away the blood on the dead man's face and head.
The face was that of a young man but was seamed
and aged by lines of dissipation. The lad, with
repugnance for the task, searched the dead man's
pockets, but found nothing but a loaded revolver
and a box of small white pellets which he decided
was dope of some kind.</p>

<p>His unpleasant task finished, the lad stepped out
of the tent, followed by his chums, who had helped
him with the dead man. The three stood silent for
a minute drinking in deep breaths of the fresh early
morning air.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with him?" the Captain
asked, jerking his head toward the tent where
the dead man lay.</p>

<p>"Keep him until afternoon," Charley said wearily.
"Some of his friends may come and claim the
body. If not, we will give him as good a funeral
as we can. It's a terrible piece of business. If all
our money was not tied up in this job, I would vote
to quit right now."</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed Captain Westfield. "I'm
getting sick of the mud and water and all the troubles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
we are having, and this last business is about
the last straw."</p>

<p>"You fellows will feel better after a little nap,
and a good breakfast," said Walter cheerfully. "I
guess none of us is in love with this new venture
of ours, but there is no good to be gained by getting
in the dumps. We must keep cheerful and do
the best we can. It is madness to talk about quitting
now. It would likely take us years of hard
work to save up the money we've got tied up in
this business."</p>

<p>"You're right," Charley acknowledged. "We
have got to fight it out. I guess I'll crawl in and
catch a catnap before breakfast. A little sleep
makes a whole lot of difference in a man's feelings."</p>

<p>Such indeed seemed to be the case, for, when a
couple of hours later he joined the rest at the
breakfast table, he was once more his old cheerful
self. During the meal he outlined his plans to
meet the new difficulty that opposed them.</p>

<p>"There's a lawyer coming out to see us to-day,"
he said, "and when he goes back I want you, Canady,
to go back with him. I'll give you a check
for $500 and I want you to buy a good pair of
mules and get them out here as soon as possible.
I will try to get some of the Indians to haul wood
while you are gone. I see there's a couple of piles
of wood left near the machine that will do to fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
up with to-morrow morning. After breakfast,
Captain, take part of the men and have them bury
the mules, and also dig a grave in that little bunch
of spruces. It ought not to take more than an
hour for the job, then all hands are to knock off
and get a good day's rest. I think we all need it.
I do not believe there is any need for a guard on
the machine to-day, but we will have to put one on
it to-night."</p>

<p>Shortly after breakfast, Willie John, the Seminole,
arrived as he had promised. Charley had not
forgotten him when he was in town and the Indian's
eyes sparkled over the bright colored cloth,
beads, and mouth organ the lads presented him
with. Before he left, Charley succeeded in hiring
him and the two teams and wagons he had in Indiantown
to haul wood for the machine until the
teamster returned with the mules. The Seminole
immediately took his departure, promising to be
back with wagons and oxen before dark.</p>

<p>He had hardly gone, when Mr. Bruce, the lawyer,
drove up in his auto. He was made welcome
in the boys' tent and Charley briefly told what had
occurred since he had seen him. The lawyer took
a look at the dead man. "He has all the appearance
of a tough," he said. "Rather an ignoble
end for a gunman, to be kicked to death by a mule.
I would advise you to bury him at once. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
at all likely that his friends will call for him. To
do so would be to give themselves away."</p>

<p>The grave was already dug and, following the
lawyer's advice, the body was at once laid to rest,
the Captain saying a brief prayer over it before
it was lowered into the grave.</p>

<p>The ceremony over, they all gathered in the
shade of a big pine and discussed their troubles
with Mr. Bruce.</p>

<p>"I confess," said the lawyer, "that I thought
your young friend was exaggerating in the story
he told me at Palm Beach, but I see now that the
trouble is far more serious than I thought. I have
not been idle since his visit to my office, and I have
discovered one or two things that are extremely
interesting, although I do not see as yet how they
solve the mystery of your troubles. I have come
out to-day to look over the ground and see if I cannot
discover some connection between the facts I
have learned and the trouble you are having. One
peculiar thing I notice in all your accounts is that,
with the exception of the placing of the dynamite
under the machine, which may have been done by
Rooney out of sheer personal cussedness, there has
been no attempt made to destroy the machine."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," Charley admitted, "but of
course they have not had much chance to get at
the machine."</p>

<p>"Another thing," continued the lawyer, "although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
you have been caused much anxiety, and worry and
have suffered considerable loss, yet no one of you
has been seriously hurt so far."</p>

<p>"I follow your reasoning, sir," Charley said.
"Your idea is that they do not wish to wreck the
machine, but merely to stop its working, and that
they do not want to kill, but merely to drive us off
the job."</p>

<p>"Correct," said the lawyer; "but I am not going
to say but what they will kill some of you if they
can't stop the job any other way."</p>

<p>"You're comforting at any rate," said Walter,
with a grin. "If we stop, we lose every dollar we
have in the world. If we don't stop we are likely
to be killed. Now which would you advise us to
do?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce laughed. "I am not going to advise
either at present," he said. "It's my duty as a lawyer
to try to save you from both. Before I give
any advice I want to look over the ground. Can
I drive on out to Indiantown in my auto?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Charley, "and we will go with you
if you do not mind."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<small>A CLEW.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span> and Walter climbed into the auto with
Mr. Bruce, who immediately started up the machine
and drove slowly out on the old road, noting
his surroundings with interest.</p>

<p>"I have never been out in this country before,"
he said. "It seems wonderfully strange and interesting
to me. So unlike anything I have ever seen
in the North. I suppose that thick growth of trees
ahead is the jungle you told me about."</p>

<p>The boys assured him that such was the case,
and before entering the jungle he stopped the car
and looked back at the machine. "At the rate your
men are working, you will have the road completed
up to the jungle in another week," he observed.</p>

<p>"Yes," Charley agreed, "that is, if we are not
molested too much. I dread the work through the
jungle, though."</p>

<p>"I should think you would dread it," agreed Mr.
Bruce as the car slipped into the jungle's gloomy
depths. "Gosh, I never saw such a sickly looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
place and these awful snakes. I'll dream of them
for weeks. Why, the place fairly reeks with fever
and disease."</p>

<p>"We are going to set fire to it before we put the
machine into it," Walter said. "The fire will kill
off a good many of the snakes, but it won't stop the
danger from fever much."</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce drove on in silence until the car rolled
into Indiantown, where he stopped it in front of
one of the truck gardens with an exclamation of
surprise. "My, I never saw stuff grow like that
before," he said. "This land must be wonderfully
fertile, although it does not look so very rich on
top."</p>

<p>"There's a soft grayish rock a little below the
surface," Charley explained. "I believe it produces
that wonderful growth. I've got some samples of
it in my game bag. You can have them if you
want them. This land is wonderfully fertile, as
you say," he continued, while Mr. Bruce examined
the bits of rock, "but I don't believe, even
with that in its favor, that it will be worth much
until a railroad runs through here. It's too far
from transportation."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mr. Bruce absently. "It is too
far away to be worth much for farming purposes."</p>

<p>The little party rode on as far as the trading-post,
then Mr. Bruce declared he had seen enough,
and turning the car around headed back for camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's queer how a really brilliant mind sometimes
overlooks plain simple little things," he said
as they slipped by the row of surveyor's stakes.
"Now the man who is directing operations against
you is a man of considerable intelligence, the ingenuity
of his moves against you prove that. He
has kept in concealment, and, in spite of all the
annoyance he has caused you, you haven't got the
slightest bit of evidence against him. Some of his
tricks have been infernally clever, and yet he has
overlooked one little thing that would have put you
out of business in a short time."</p>

<p>"Don't name it out loud," Charley begged. "I
noticed it long ago, but I haven't even dared think
of it for fear it might occur to him."</p>

<p>"I don't know but what you fellows are in the
same class with him," said Mr. Bruce, with a smile.
"This case reminds me of a story by Edgar Allan
Poe about a long search for a hidden document.
All sorts of out-of-the-way nooks and places were
searched, and all the while the document lay in
full view upon a mantel shelf."</p>

<p>"You mean that we have overlooked the solution
of our troubles because it was in plain sight?" said
Walter eagerly.</p>

<p>"Something like that," Mr. Bruce admitted. "I
am not positive about it yet, but I expect to be
within a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to
refuse to answer any questions about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not yet noon when they got back to camp
and Mr. Bruce retired at once to Charley's tent and
began filling in the blank places on a lot of legal
forms he had brought with him. "I want all you
Americans to sign these without asking any questions,"
he said. "I know it's rather an unusual
request, but this case is rather an unusual one, so
you will have to do this blindfold if you want me to
go on with your case. You will just have to trust
to my honor, that's all."</p>

<p>Without any hesitation, our little party affixed
their signatures to the papers, the contents of which
the lawyer kept carefully hidden. They reasoned
that in their present position they had nothing to
lose, if the lawyer proved dishonest, which they did
not believe he would, for they were all favorably
impressed with his appearance and brisk, business-like
manner.</p>

<p>After they had signed, the teamster and engineers
were called in and also asked to sign, which
they willingly did, without question or comment.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Bruce, when the signing was
over, "I'll be going, for I've got to do some hustling
the next few days if I am going to be of any use
to you."</p>

<p>"Better wait for dinner," Charley urged, but
Mr. Bruce shook his head. "I'll get a lunch in
Jupiter," he said. "Every hour is important now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
I wish you had come to me sooner; as it is, I have
only a short time to do a whole lot of work in."</p>

<p>Charley followed him out to the auto. "I wish
you would tell us what you have discovered and
what you are going to do," he said.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not going to do that," said the lawyer
decidedly, "not until I am sure that I am right. Do
you think you can keep on working and stand those
fellows off for a week longer?"</p>

<p>"I think so," Charley said simply.</p>

<p>"Good," approved Mr. Bruce, "I will be back
within a week. I must warn you, however, that if
my theories are correct the further you dig the
more trouble you are likely to have. I expect the
enemy will abandon all tricks and resort to attempts
to kill before the week is out."</p>

<p>"That's a cheerful outlook," said Charley dryly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce hesitated before replying. "As a
lawyer," he said, "I am against killing in any form,
but as a mere man I would say that I would shoot
to kill if the other fellow was doing the same."</p>

<p>"But killing is an awful thing," protested Charley.
"It is never justified except in war."</p>

<p>"Then just consider that this is war," smiled the
lawyer. "You will not have to stretch your imagination
much. Good-by. I will be back in a
week." The teamster climbed into the auto with
him and in a few minutes the car was out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Charley slowly returned to the camp, where he
told his chums what the lawyer had said.</p>

<p>"I think I know about where those gunmen are
camped," Walter said. "I can see the smoke of a
campfire near where the convicts camped. If we
have any more trouble with them, we could, perhaps,
capture them in the daytime when they are
sleeping and turn them over to the sheriff."</p>

<p>Charley shook his head. "That won't do," he
said. "In the first place, even counting in the
engineers, there would only be seven of us to do the
job, for we could not count on the Spaniards. They
lack the nerve for such work. Seven men could
hardly handle twenty. In the second place, we
have no evidence against any of them, except the
one who killed the mules, and he is dead. If we
turned them over to the sheriff he would have to
turn them loose again."</p>

<p>"You're right about the Spaniards lacking nerve,"
Captain Westfield observed. "All these mysterious
night attacks are frightening them. I am afraid
we are going to have trouble holding them if this
sort of thing continues."</p>

<p>"I've been fearing that very thing," Charley said
thoughtfully. "They are a superstitious people and
what they cannot understand frightens them. I
can see only one thing more that we can do and
that is for Walt and I to go on the night guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
with them, and if there is any shooting we had
better do as the lawyer says&mdash;shoot back."</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of bloodshed," said Captain
Westfield.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Charley grimly. "But if blood must
be shed I would rather it would be theirs than ours."</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed Walter. "If we are going
to keep watch to-night, Charley, we had better eat
dinner and turn in for a nap."</p>

<p>It was nearly sundown when the boys emerged
from their tents where they had been awakened
from their sleep by a clamoring outside.</p>

<p>They found the din the herald of the arrival of
Willie John with all his worldly goods, consisting
of numerous dogs, pigs, cattle, two wagons, eight
oxen, a squaw, his mother and his mother-in-law,
a crowd of children, and a couple of wrinkled old
Indians, likely his father and father-in-law.</p>

<p>Much to the chums' relief, Willie John decided
to make camp further on close to the machine.
After they had reached their camping place, Willie
John left the squaws to the ignoble menial work of
making camp, and with his son, a fine looking Indian
lad, came over to discuss business with his
pale-face employers.</p>

<p>"Me drive one wagon, four oxen," he said. "Boy
drive one wagon, four oxen. How much?"</p>

<p>"Six dollars a day," said Charley promptly.
"Six dollars and plenty of tobacco."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is well," said the Seminole. "Some tobacco
now."</p>

<p>Charley went to the supply and got a package,
and the Indian, filling his pipe, sat down on a log
and puffed away in silent content, his son sitting
by his side silent and motionless except for the
quick shifting of his black, beady eyes that took in
every detail of the camp and its occupants.</p>

<p>"Fine boy you've got," observed Walter, who
had been admiring the perfect form and proud carriage
of the Indian lad.</p>

<p>There was a glint of fatherly pride in Willie
John's eyes as he laid his hand caressingly on the
lad's black head. "Him good boy," he said simply.
"Him run faster, wrestle better, swim better than
any other Indian boy. Him no drink wyomee
(whiskey). Him no smoke. Him save all money.
By and bye, he go to school, all the same as pale-face
boy."</p>

<p>"That's good," Walter approved. "How old
is he?"</p>

<p>"Twelve years," answered the Seminole. "We
go back to camp now. Good-by."</p>

<p>"He certainly thinks a lot of that boy for an Indian,"
Walter remarked to his chum.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Charley. "Don't you suppose
Indians have feelings like other human beings?"</p>

<p>Both lads had occasion to remember this conversation
in the near future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<small>SICKNESS IN THE CAMP.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to agreement, as soon as night fell,
Charley, taking two of the Spaniards with him,
went out to stand guard on the machine for the
night, while Walter and the other two took their
posts on the guard line circling the camp. There
is nothing so slow and tedious as doing guard duty,
but the boys managed to hasten the flight of time
by chatting with their Spanish companions and adding
new words and phrases to their already fair
knowledge of the language.</p>

<p>Much to their surprise nothing occurred to alarm
the lads during the night. At daybreak Charley
climbed up on the steel crane and took a good look
over the country, but he could discover no trace
of the enemy or any sign of campfire smoke.</p>

<p>With the break of day the fireman came out to
get up steam, and Charley with his men returned to
camp. "I can't see any trace of them or their
campfire," he told his chum, "and I believe I've
hit upon the reason why we were not molested last
night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's have it," said Walter eagerly.</p>

<p>"I believe they think they have put us out of
business with the killing of the mules and the burning
of our wood supply," Charley answered. "Of
course they will soon discover their mistake and be
at it again."</p>

<p>"Maybe they have gone back to town," his chum
suggested hopefully, but Charley shook his head
decidedly. "They would not go far," he declared
positively. "They know it will not take us more
than four or five days at the most to get another
pair of mules and start up again. Well, let's be
thankful for their giving us even one night's peace.
I am going to get a bite to eat and turn in, and I
advise you to do the same. If we wake up early
enough we'll take the truck, run in to town and see
if that electric light has come."</p>

<p>"All right," Walter agreed.</p>

<p>It was nearly sundown when the boys awoke,
so the purposed trip was not made. As the machine
was now working again, there was no need
of a guard on it, so the boys agreed to divide up
the camp watch. One standing guard with the
Spaniards until midnight, and the other one from
midnight until morning. "I'll take the first watch,"
Charley said, "then I can get a good nap and run
into town in the morning."</p>

<p>Before going out to his post, Charley sauntered
over to the Indian's camp and exchanged greetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
with Willie John. "Did you see any pale-faces in
the woods to-day?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The Seminole shook his head. "No see strange
pale-face," he said. "See campfire. Him one sleep
old. Pale-faces gone."</p>

<p>"Well," said Charley, puzzled. "You must not
go near any pale-face camp in woods. They very
bad men. Maybe they shoot you or oxen. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, me understand," said the Seminole. "No
go near campfires any more."</p>

<p>"The gunmen have either moved camp or gone
to town," the lad remarked to his chum when he
returned to camp. "But we will keep watch just
the same. It may be only a ruse to throw us off
our guard."</p>

<p>The night passed away, however, without the
slightest alarm, much to the lad's relief. Charley
slept later than usual in the morning, and when he
emerged from his tent he found the Captain waiting
for him.</p>

<p>"One of the graders is sick," the old sailor informed
him. "I wish you would take a look at
him. He looks to me to be pretty badly off."</p>

<p>The lad found the sick man, one of their best
workers, tossing restlessly on his cot, his face a
brick red.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Meticas?" he said cheerfully
as he felt of the sick man's hot face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Plenty sick, señor," said the sufferer. "Plenty
not all the time. No can work to-day. Work to-morrow,
maybe."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about the work," said the lad
kindly. "I go to town this morning, get doctor.
He will make you well pretty quick."</p>

<p>"Thanks, señor," said the man gratefully.</p>

<p>"It looks to me like a case of jungle fever," the
lad said as he joined the Captain.</p>

<p>"It's working in that nasty mud all the time that
has made him sick," the old sailor declared. "The
hot sun burning down on that foul muck is enough
to make an alligator sick. It don't bother me much,
for I get off to one side and keep out of it. It's
hardest on the ground men and the graders. They
are in it all the time. They don't complain any,
but I notice they are getting sores all over their
legs from standing in it. It would not surprise me
if more of them came down before long."</p>

<p>"I hope not," Charley said fervently. "We are
in enough trouble as it is. I am going in and get
a doctor for him this morning. You can take out
one of the guards with you to take Meticas' place."</p>

<p>As soon as he had eaten breakfast, the lad took
the truck and started for town. By noon he was
back in camp again.</p>

<p>"Gosh, you made a quick trip," Walter commented.</p>

<p>"I didn't go to town," Charley said dejectedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
"Two miles from here is as far as I could get with
the truck."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded his chum.</p>

<p>"Bridges blown up by dynamite from there on,"
said the other briefly. "I walked ahead two miles
from where I left the truck and there was not a
bridge but what was wholly or partly wrecked."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Walter, "that will shut us off
from getting more supplies."</p>

<p>"That's what it was intended to do," said his
chum wearily, "but, I think, we can fool them on
that point if we act quickly. Has Willie John come
in for his dinner yet?"</p>

<p>"I think he is over at his camp now."</p>

<p>"Come on over with me," Charley said. "We
have got to act quickly or we will find ourselves
penned up out here without food."</p>

<p>They found Willie John and his family squatted
around a big iron pot full of bear meat into which
they kept dipping their hands and fishing after
choice tid-bits.</p>

<p>"This afternoon you and boy go to Indiantown
for us," Charley said. "You tell all of tribe we
want to buy plenty yams, corn, pumpkins, pigs, and
two cattle, then go out to trading-post and buy all
the flour, sugar and coffee Mr. Bowers will sell.
Have Indians bring all here to camp quick. Pretty
soon bad pale-faces tear up bridge so we can no get
grub. You understand?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, me understand," said the Seminole. "Me
go on foot. Indians got plenty of wagons to bring
grub. Go much faster walk. Boy and squaw drive
oxen and haul wood while I am gone."</p>

<p>"Good," Charley approved. "You come over to
camp before you go and I give you plenty of money
to buy grub with."</p>

<p>"That will settle the food question for quite a
while," the lad observed, as the two boys sauntered
back to the tent.</p>

<p>"We don't really need anything from town for
quite a while, except a doctor. I am going to see
if I cannot do something for the sick man, but if
he gets worse, we will have to get a couple of Indian
ponies and go in for a doctor. By leaving the
road and taking to the woods one can pick their
way into town, but it would make a long, tiresome,
dangerous journey, and we don't want to attempt it
unless we absolutely have to."</p>

<p>Charley found the sick man about as he had left
him, hot with fever and tossing restlessly. After
viewing his condition carefully, the lad went back
to his tent and got out the little medicine chest they
usually carried with them.</p>

<p>"What are you going to give him?" Walter inquired.</p>

<p>"A big dose of calomel now, and as soon as the
fever passes off I will give him two grain doses of
quinine every two hours," said Charley promptly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
"That's what the doctors always give for these
swamp fevers. I am not much afraid of this kind
of fever. It seldom kills and when properly treated
it is easily cured. Of course it leaves one weak for
a while, and not able to do much work. I wish,
though, that I knew what to do to keep the mud
from making sores on the men. I am more afraid
of the sores than I am of the fever."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about medicine," said
Walter thoughtfully, "but it is evident that the sores
come from germs or poisons in the mud. Now if
the men would put carbolic acid in the water when
they bathe morning and night and then put on some
carbolic salve, I believe it would check or kill that
which makes the sores."</p>

<p>"I believe you're right," Charley agreed. "We
will have them try it anyway. As soon as I can get
to town I am going to get leggins for them all.
That will keep the mud from coming in direct contact
with their skins. Well, we had better get what
rest we can now. Those fellows have finished
with the bridges and they will likely be back to
make us more trouble to-night. I don't feel as
though I had got enough sleep anyway."</p>

<p>The two lads wisely retired to their cots, where
they gained a couple of hours of good hard slumber
from which they were awakened by the arrival of
Willie John returning from his errand. "Wagons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
come pretty soon, bring plenty grub," he informed
them.</p>

<p>Before dark the wagons began to arrive, loaded
with yams, pumpkins, corn, and young pigs, besides
all the flour, sugar and coffee Mr. Bowers
had been able to spare from the trading-post.</p>

<p>The boys viewed the supply of food with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"There's enough to run us a couple of months,"
Charley declared, "and by that time we will either
be doing well or else driven off the job." Before
night fell the lad went in and took another look at
the sick man. The fever had left him, so he gave
him the first dose of two grains of quinine. "Repeat
it every two hours until you go to bed," he
told the Captain, who had come in from work. "I'll
manage to slip in a couple of times after you retire
and give it to him."</p>

<p>"There is another one coming down with it,"
the old sailor said gloomily. "Rama has been
yawning and complaining of aching bones all day."</p>

<p>"Send him in here and to-morrow take out one
of the guards in his place," said the lad promptly.
"I am going to have the rest of the men move out
of this tent into the others and turn this one into a
hospital tent where the men can be quiet and undisturbed."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<small>A MIDNIGHT RAID.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Spaniards sharing the sick man's tent willingly
complied with Charley's request and moved
their belongings to the other tents in which there
was plenty of room for them. With Walter's assistance
the lad cleaned the tent out thoroughly
and tied back the flaps at both ends to permit the
free circulation of air. Rama was made to go to
bed on a second cot and given a dose of the same
medicine given the other. This done, Charley
called the balance of the graders and ground men
together and gave them a large bottle of carbolic
acid and a box of salve, instructing them how to
use both. It was now getting dark, and after a
hasty supper the boys with their two Spaniards
repaired to the guard line. Before night, however,
Walter had climbed a small tree and taken a survey
of the country. Much to his disappointment,
he had seen smoke rising from the convicts' old
camping place, showing that the gunmen had returned
to their old haunts.</p>

<p>"I wonder how they manage to find our camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
so easy at night," the lad remarked, as he and his
chum met on their rounds. "When McCarty and
I were out hunting that time we could not see this
camp from theirs, and after we camped in the
thicket we could not see their camp, although we
were not over half a mile away. The white mist
blotted out everything."</p>

<p>"That digging light way up on the machine's
boom guides them," Charley answered. "The mist
is densest close to the ground. The further up one
goes the thinner it gets; consequently they can see
that light even when they can't see our campfire."</p>

<p>"Simple enough, after all," Walter commented.
"It's the simple things that puzzle one the most
sometimes."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me of what Mr. Bruce hinted,"
Charley said, "that the solution of our mystery was
in plain sight all the time, but hanged if I haven't
puzzled over it till I made my head swim and can't
make it out."</p>

<p>"Same here," Walter said. "I hope he is right
and can make an end to this trouble, but I doubt it."</p>

<p>"Well, we will know in a few days. He promised
to be out again within a week."</p>

<p>The lads turned back on their patrol and the conversation
ceased.</p>

<p>The hours slipped slowly away while the four
guards kept up their slow, weary, monotonous pacing
back and forth. Three times Charley slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in and administered doses of quinine. On the last
trip he passed by the cook tent and, striking a
match, glanced at the clock inside.</p>

<p>"It's just midnight," he said as he rejoined his
chum. "That seems to be the favorite time for
their devilment. I suppose we can look for trouble
any minute now." He had hardly finished when
there came the sharp crack of rifles from about the
machine. "Good," Charley exclaimed, "they
haven't all got silent guns this time. Those reports
will give our men an idea where to shoot."</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better go out there?" Walter asked.</p>

<p>"No, we may have our hands full here," his
chum replied. "Besides, the engineer will whistle
if he wants us. Gee, look at that!"</p>

<p>The swinging platform of the machine was turning
around and around at great speed and from it
burst forth little jets of flame as the machine men
answered the enemy's fire.</p>

<p>"Good boy, McCarty," Walter exclaimed. "I
guess they will have a job hitting any of your
men." He ducked as a bullet whizzed close by him.</p>

<p>"Watch out!" Charley cried, "they have got the
camp surrounded, too."</p>

<p>"Shoot wherever you see a flash, then step to one
side so they won't locate your position."</p>

<p>The Captain, Chris and the two engineers came
running from the camp half dressed with their guns
in their hands. By the time they reached the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>,
the rifles of both defenders and attackers were
crackling merrily and the bullets were whining back
and forth. For half an hour the firing continued
on both sides, then the attacking party slowly withdrew,
firing as they retired. The attempt on the
machine had quickly been silenced, and McCarty
was digging again as though nothing had happened.
Lanterns were lit and the defenders took stock of
the damage done. Captain Westfield had a scratch
on the leg where a bullet had grazed, one of the
Spaniards had lost a finger tip, and a cow staked
out within the line had been killed. Whether the
enemy had suffered from their fire they could not
tell.</p>

<p>"I doubt if they were hurt much," Charley observed.
"I think they did most of their fighting
from behind trees. We want to take a lesson from
them on that. To-morrow we will have to fix up
some kind of protection to get behind when the
fun begins. I do not expect we will get off as
lucky next time as we did this. I believe they were
trying to scare us this time more than anything
else."</p>

<p>Satisfied that the trouble was over for the night,
the Captain and his companions returned to bed
while the lads resumed their weary round of sentinel
duty. Nothing more occurred to disturb them,
and they were heartily glad when day at last came.
As soon as it grew light enough to see well, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
two lads went out and examined the place from
which their enemies had fired. They found nothing,
however, but a few drops of blood on the grass
beside a tree. "Some one got barked a little here,"
Charley observed. "It wasn't anything serious,
however, or there would be more blood around."</p>

<p>The boys had just finished breakfast when one
of the Spaniards came in from the machine.</p>

<p>"Boss, McCarty want you to come out to the machine,"
he said to Charley.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the trouble is now," said the
boy wearily, as he arose and put on his hat. "Want
to walk out with me, Walt?"</p>

<p>"Sure," his chum assented.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Charley asked of the
white-faced Spaniard who accompanied them back.</p>

<p>The Spaniard hastily crossed himself. "God
knows," he said with a shudder. "It's blood that
we wash in and blood that we drink. May the
Blessed Virgin forgive us."</p>

<p>As they were near the machine, the lads did not
question him further, but hastened on to where
McCarty was standing a little ways beyond the
road.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Charley asked the engineer.</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself," was the reply.
"Look at that little brook over there where we have
been getting our water. Last night it was just ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
sweet, pure, cold water, but just look at it
now."</p>

<p>The two lads stepped over to the tiny brook McCarty
pointed out. It was only a few feet wide
and three or four inches in depth, except where the
machine men had dug a hole a couple of feet deep
to make possible the dipping up of a few bucketfuls
at a time. The boy's eyes opened wide with wonder
and surprise, for the waters of the little rill
were red like blood.</p>

<p>"Queer, isn't it?" said McCarty. "Hanged if I
can account for it."</p>

<p>"I have seen brooks of that color where the water
flowed over red bay tree roots," Walter volunteered.</p>

<p>"That color does not come from bay roots," objected
the other. "You want to remember that it
was all right and colorless yesterday. We got a
fresh pail of water about two hours ago. Of course
we did not notice the color then because it was
dark, but one of the men went to get a drink a
while ago and I thought he would throw a fit when
he saw the color of the stuff he had been drinking.
Bossie washed his face and hands in the brook a
couple of hours ago and just look at him now."
The lads glanced at the Spaniard, whose frightened
face was a bright red. "They want to quit," McCarty
continued in a low voice. "This, coming
after all the other mystery, has scared them out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
their wits. Unless you can hit upon some reasonable
explanation of this thing and do it quick, I am
afraid the whole gang will quit. They have been
crossing themselves and muttering prayers to the
Virgin for the last hour."</p>

<p>A glance at the three frightened Spaniards convinced
the two lads that McCarty was not exaggerating
the seriousness of the situation.</p>

<p>"Keep them here until I come back," Charley
told him softly. "Come on, Walt, I am going to
follow that rill up to its source."</p>

<p>They had not far to go. A couple of hundred
yards from the machine they found the rill's source
among a clump of willows. Here a little spring
bubbled up from the ground. Near its mouth, fastened
tightly to a stake, was an object that caused
the boy to utter exclamations of surprise and relief.
It was a muslin bag capable of holding eight or
ten pounds and it was stained a bright red. It had
been cunningly placed in a narrow part of the rill
and the dirt banked up on both sides so that all the
water from the spring would have to pass through
or over it.</p>

<p>"Don't touch it," Charley said. "Go bring the
machine men here. I want to make this an object
lesson to them."</p>

<p>While Walter was gone on this errand, the lad
gathered up several pasteboard packages that lay
scattered around on the ground. He noted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
satisfaction that the directions on them were printed
in Spanish as well as English.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Walter was back with the wondering
Spaniards. Relief began to replace the look
of fright on their faces as Charley silently pointed
out to them the red stained bag and, untying it
from the stake, undid the string closing its mouth
and shook out on the ground a mass of water-soaked
red powder. He picked up three of the
packages he had collected and gave one to each of
the Spaniards. "Read," he said shortly. The
Spaniards burst out laughing as they grasped the
cause of the thing that had so frightened them.</p>

<p>"Our enemies want to stop us from building this
road," Charley said in Spanish. "They are fools.
They think by firing off their guns in the air at
night, starting fires in the grass, and coloring water
red with dyes, that they can frighten away the
brave, noble sons of Spain. Surely they are fools."</p>

<p>"They are fools," agreed Bossie, now completely
recovered from his fright. "They might frighten
children, but Spaniards never. No other race is as
brave and fearless as the sons of Spain."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<small>BURNING OUT THE JUNGLE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the boys left the machine to return to
camp the men were in the highest of spirits and the
ground men were joking Bossie about his red face.</p>

<p>"I really believe that dye business is going to
work out to our advantage," Charley remarked to
his chum. "Those Spaniards will not be so likely
to get frightened next time at a little thing they do
not understand."</p>

<p>"I hope you're right," Walter said, "but, if these
night attacks keep up much longer, I believe all
the men will quit, and I shall not blame them if
they do. One cannot expect men to work hard and
then have targets made of them every night, all for
$2.00 a day."</p>

<p>"No," Charley agreed, "but we have got to hold
them as long as we can. I am in hopes that Mr.
Bruce will come to our rescue in some way. If he
does not and this sort of thing continues, we are
bound to go under sooner or later. We will simply
be unable to keep men on the job."</p>

<p>"How do we stand now?" Walter asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't figured it out exactly," his chum replied,
"but we are not much ahead of the game, for
our expenses so far have been enormous. After this
month's wages have been paid the men we will have
but little left. Of course, we have got the part of
the reward for the convicts coming and the money
from the sale of the rings, but we have got neither
of those yet and we cannot tell when we will get
them. We are well equipped for three months
ahead now, plenty of food, a new pair of mules on
the way, and new parts for the machine. We will
be under but little expense for several months to
come. We are making good money on the digging,
and if we could continue it in peace, we would have
a good lump sum coming to us at the end of the job.
But if this interference keeps up, the machine will
be laid up and we will be broke&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"But there's the money for what we have already
done," suggested Walter hopefully.</p>

<p>"We will not get that until the middle of next
month," his chum said gloomily. "If we are forced
to quit the job before then we will get nothing.
The county will keep it for failure to carry out our
contract. We have just simply got to keep the machine
working, that's all."</p>

<p>When the boys arrived at camp, Charley went at
once to the hospital tent, where he found both sick
men slightly improved. He left four quinine tablets
with each, with directions to take one every two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
hours. To Chris he gave instructions to prepare
some rich broth and dry toast for the invalids.
This done, the two lads turned in and slept soundly
until well along in the afternoon.</p>

<p>They found the Captain had not been idle while
they rested. With his graders he had thrown up
mounds of dirt and roots every fifty feet circling
the camp.</p>

<p>"Good!" approved Charley, as he viewed the old
sailor's work. "When we get behind those we will
be fairly safe from bullets. I wish those trees out
there were out of the way. They give the enemy
too much protection."</p>

<p>"There are only about a dozen of them big
enough to give any protection," Walter observed.
"Why not blow them up with dynamite?"</p>

<p>The suggestion was a good one and they immediately
set about carrying it out. Assisted by the
Captain with his graders, they dug holes under the
trees' roots and placing several sticks of dynamite
under each, thus exploded them with a fuse and
cap. The powerful explosive blew the big trees
clear out of the ground and in some cases many feet
above ground before they fell.</p>

<p>"That's better," said Charley, with satisfaction
when the job was completed.</p>

<p>"We can make still another improvement," Walter
suggested. "Why not set fire to the roots?
They are pitchy enough to burn good and the fires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
will show up any one trying to approach the camp."</p>

<p>The idea was so feasible that the lads carried it
out at once, and by the time night fell a bright glowing
ring of fires surrounded the camp.</p>

<p>"I don't believe they will bother us to-night with
all those fires going, but we'll keep watch just the
same," Charley said. "We cannot be too careful."</p>

<p>The camp was not molested during the night, but
about the middle of the night there came explosions
at regular intervals from the direction of Indiantown.</p>

<p>Charley chuckled. "They are shutting the stable
door after the horse is stolen," he remarked. "They
are blowing up the bridges between here and Indiantown."</p>

<p>"I expected that would be their next move.
That's why I was in such a hurry to get the provisions
from the Indians."</p>

<p>"But the blowing up of the bridges ahead of us
will stop the machine," Walter said.</p>

<p>"No, it will only delay us a little," his chum replied.
"It's easily remedied. When the machine
gets to a blown-up bridge it will simply face around
and fill up the gap with mud and sand, and after
it has passed over it will dig out the gap again and
our bridgemen will put in a new bridge, which they
would have to do anyway."</p>

<p>"I see," said Walter, greatly relieved. "Things
are not always as bad as they seem."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>But while the lads had reason to be thankful for
a quiet night, they were not encouraged by the
state of affairs in the camp next morning. Two
more men, a ground man and a grader, were down
with the fever. The condition of the other two
sick men was greatly improved, but it was plainly
evident that it would still be several days before
they would be strong enough to go to work.</p>

<p>The lads provided the new sick ones with medicine
and made them as comfortable as they could
before they themselves retired to rest.</p>

<p>"You'll have to get along with one man to-day,
and let the other one go on the machine gang,"
Charley told the Captain. "To-morrow the guards
will be rested up and you can have them to help
you. Walt and I will keep watch alone hereafter."</p>

<p>"If this thing keeps up much longer it will not
need the enemy to put us out of business," he remarked
to his chum as they prepared for bed. "We
can't spare another man off the job. If just one
more man caves in we will only be able to run the
machine half time, and that's a losing proposition.
The worst of it is that we cannot get into town to
get more men until Canady returns with the mules.
I can't imagine what's keeping him. He ought to
have been back yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, let's not worry until the things actually
happen," said Walter sleepily, as he stretched out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
on his cot. "It don't pay to cross a bridge until
you get to it."</p>

<p>"We have got to set fire to that jungle to-day,"
said Charley some hours later, as rested and refreshed,
the lads ate their mid-afternoon meal.
"The machine is within a thousand feet of it now.
It will not do to wait until it gets closer, for the
heat from that fire is going to be intense. We can't
do better than to start it right now. The wind is
blowing away from the machine, so the crew will
not be troubled with the smoke."</p>

<p>The boys stopped at the first wood pile and split
up a log of fat pine into long sticks for torches.
Carrying these and a plentiful supply of matches,
they made their way out to the edge of the jungle,
which was not far from their new camp. Lighting
their torches, one went north and the other south,
scattering fire as they went. After they had started
blazes for a couple of hundred yards either way,
they returned to the road and watched the progress
of the flames.</p>

<p>"Isn't there danger of its sweeping on into Indiantown?"
asked Walter, as the flames began to
mount skyward.</p>

<p>"No," replied his chum. "I made sure of that
before I decided to set fire to it. There is a creek
running along the other side of the jungle that will
stop its progress. Just look at it. Did you ever see
anything like it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The two boys stood and watched with awe the
mighty conflagration they had started. The jungle
was filled with dead and dying trees which flamed
up like tinder at the fire's breath. Soon the flames
were shooting up forty or fifty feet high and the
roaring was like that of a mighty tempest. The
heat quickly grew so intense that the boys were
compelled to retreat slowly back to the machine.
Even there the heat could be felt, although it was a
thousand feet to the jungle and the wind was blowing
the fire away from them.</p>

<p>The engineer stopped the machine for a few minutes
to give all hands a chance to view the wonderful
sight.</p>

<p>As the pillars of flame and smoke reared themselves
skyward, the boys realized with astonishment
that the jungle that had seemed so lifeless was
really teeming with life. From both sides of the
mighty blaze rose great flocks of blue and white
cranes, egrets, whoopers, owls, parrots, great scarlet
flamingoes, and dozens of strange birds the like
of which the boys had never seen before. Nor was
animal life lacking in either number or variety.
Hundreds of hairy swamp rabbits, as big as a small
dog, poured out from their doomed hiding places.
Great big rats by the thousands swarmed by the
machine. A couple of deer went by, covering the
ground with great bounds. Wild cats, foxes, squirrels
poured forth in great numbers. One huge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
sprawling object emerged from the thicket and lumbered
toward the machine, but before reaching it
turned aside and sunk with a splash in a nearby
lake.</p>

<p>"Whew!" breathed the engineer, "that was the
grandfather of all alligators. He must be all of
twenty feet long."</p>

<p>As the fire spread to either side the flow of animal
life was diverted in other directions and their
rushing by the machine ceased.</p>

<p>"I believe that fire will kill every snake in the
jungle," Charley declared with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I doubt it. They will just keep under water
until it is all over," his chum replied.</p>

<p>"That water is shoal and stagnant," Charley reminded
him. "Burning branches and trees are
dropping in it all the time. I'll bet it is actually
boiling by now."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<small>SHOOTING TO KILL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> night came Charley and Walter had to
go on the picket line alone, for the two remaining
Spanish guards would have to join the grading gang
in the morning. They adopted the plan the first
two Spanish guards had used of each one making
a half circle of the camp. For several hours they
paced wearily back and forth, but as midnight drew
near they became more watchful and alert, for this
was the hour that their enemies generally chose to
make their attacks.</p>

<p>All the camp was fast asleep and silence reigned
unbroken, except for the exhaust of the machine
and the occasional heavy fall of a fire-eaten tree in
the jungle. But in their loneliness the boys were
comforted by the knowledge that in their tents
Captain, Chris, the engineers, and many of the
Spaniards were sleeping, fully dressed with their
guns by their sides, ready to run to the lads' assistance
at the first alarm.</p>

<p>And soon it came, the sharp crack of rifles around
both camp and machine. The two lads answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
promptly, firing at the bright streaks of the blazing
rifles in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Keep down, keep down. Get behind the sand
heaps," Charley shouted, as those in the tents came
running to their assistance. "Keep down. They
are shooting to kill this time."</p>

<p>A rain of bullets thudded against the sand heaps
as the defenders dropped behind them and fired
over the tops. The darkness was pierced with
streaks of spurting fire as rifle spoke to rifle. It
was evident that the enemy were shooting to kill,
and the defenders did the same. Wherever a rifle
flash lit up the darkness they aimed at the place and
quickly fired. Occasional cries and oaths told them
that some of their bullets were finding their mark.
But they were not to go unhurt for their part.
Charley, who had raised himself up to fire, felt the
thud of a bullet and his left arm dropped helplessly
by his side. In the excitement he felt no pain, but,
letting go his rifle, he drew his automatic and blazed
away with it. Walter, behind the next pile, had his
straw hat shot off his head. Bob Bratton pitched
forward on his face and lay still and motionless,
while one of the Spaniards sank to the ground, his
hand clapped to a wounded leg and cursed fluently.
Once Walter glanced back at the machine. Its
platform was revolving rapidly and the rifles of its
crew were spatting viciously. But the enemy did
not now have the protection of the trees, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
could not long face the hail of lead being poured
upon them. Their firing suddenly ceased. From
where they had stood came piercing shrieks, and
following the shrieks came frightened yells and the
thud of running feet.</p>

<p>"Captain, take most of the men and go to the aid
of the machine," Charley commanded. "The fighting
is over here." The old sailor hurried away,
followed by McCarty and most of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>From the darkness ahead of the two boys still
came the awful shrieks.</p>

<p>"Chris, get a lantern, we must find out what's the
matter out there," Charley said.</p>

<p>The little negro was back in a minute with the
light and, taking it from him, Walter led the way
hastily toward the shrieks which were growing
fainter. He was closely followed by his chum and
Chris with their automatics in their hands. As the
lantern lit up the scene of the shrieks, Walter
shrank back with a cry of fear and horror. A
hideous head with lidless gleaming eyes was reared
many feet above the ground. Recovering himself
with an effort, the lad raised his automatic and
fired directly between the gleaming eyes. At the
same minute Charley and Chris discharged their
weapons and the hideous head fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Holding aloft the light, the three frightened boys
advanced cautiously. Its rays shone down on a
sickening sight. On the ground lay one of the gunmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
crushed into a shapeless mass, while, still partly
coiled around the man's body, a great boa constrictor
writhed in its last death struggles.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" shuddered Walter, "I did not know there
was such an awful thing in Florida."</p>

<p>"Fire drove it out of the jungle, I guess," said
Charley jerkingly. "Let's get back to camp. Bratton
has fallen and one of the Spaniards is badly
hurt. We can do nothing here, it's all over."</p>

<p>They had carried Bratton in and laid him upon
his cot and were helping the wounded Spaniard in,
when Walter cried:</p>

<p>"Look at the machine! Look at the machine!"</p>

<p>The machine and the air about it was a mass of
flames. Black figures were leaping from its platform.</p>

<p>"Rifle bullet hit gas tank," muttered Charley
dreamily. "Explosion. Can't work nights. Keep
her going daytimes, Walt. Enough men unhurt to
do that. I'm tired, awfully tired. Think I'll go to
sleep pretty soon," and the lad, weak from loss of
blood, sank unconscious to the ground.</p>

<p>When Charley opened his eyes it was to find
himself in his cot, his arm neatly bound in splints,
the sun shining in the open tent flaps, and Walter
sitting on a box by his side.</p>

<p>"How did I get here?" he asked in wonder. "The
last I remember was the machine being in flames."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"You keeled over in a faint," Walter replied
cheerfully. "Loss of blood, I guess."</p>

<p>"Was there any one killed?" Charley demanded
anxiously.</p>

<p>"We thought Bratton was for a while, but the
bullet hit a rib and glanced out again, making only
a flesh wound. He'll be all right again in a week.
The three Spaniards on the machine got pretty
badly burned, but not dangerously so. Luckily for
them, the ditch was there. They jumped right off
the machine into it. The engineer by some miracle
escaped without a burn. Sicavia, the Spaniard that
was wounded in the leg, will be around again in a
few days. He has only got a flesh wound. I guess
that's all, except we buried that dead gunman this
morning."</p>

<p>"The machine, is it running?" Charley questioned
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I got them to start her up again this morning.
But we can't run her nights for we have
neither lights nor a night crew."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Charley gravely. "I see that
there's worse to follow."</p>

<p>"Well, if you will have it, I suppose you might
as well learn it now as a little later," Walter said.
"The fact is the whole gang of Spaniards are going
to quit. I had hard work to get any of them to
remain over to-day."</p>

<p>"I suppose this is the end," said Charley, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
wry smile. "Well, we have fought a good fight,
and I, for one, am not going to give up yet."</p>

<p>"There is such a thing as knowing when one is
licked," his chum said sadly, "and I think about
every one on the job has reached that point. I do
not see how we can do anything more."</p>

<p>Charley lay quiet for a minute thinking, then he
said quietly: "Will you get me about a pint of hot,
strong coffee, Walt?"</p>

<p>"Sure," answered his chum quickly, glad to see
Charley taking the ill news so quietly.</p>

<p>When he returned it was to find his chum sitting
on the edge of his cot trying to dress, but making
an awkward job of it with only one hand.</p>

<p>"You must not get up," he protested, but Charley
only smiled and said lightly: "Nonsense, a broken
arm is no excuse for lying in bed. Why, it don't
even pain me much. The pain will come later when
the bone begins to knit. Will you please get all the
men together? I want to talk with them a bit."</p>

<p>When Walter had gone the lad finished dressing
and drank the strong coffee, which put new strength
in his body.</p>

<p>When he emerged from the tent it was to find
that his chum had gathered together in a body outside
all the men but those confined to the hospital
tent. He had even brought in the men from the
machine, which had been stopped for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Charley wasted no time in idle words, but came
directly to the point.</p>

<p>"My chum tells me, men, that you all want to
quit," he said in Spanish.</p>

<p>"Si, señor, si, señor (Yes sir, yes sir), came the
eager answer from the crowd.</p>

<p>"You are your own masters," continued the lad.
"Of course, you are free to quit whenever you
want to and there will be no trouble about getting
your money when you wish to go, although your
month is not up yet." He paused for a moment
and looked over the eager faces gathered before
him, before he continued: "I would not attempt
to keep you on this job against your will, but I will
say that I think it is foolish of you to quit now.
All the bridges between here and Jupiter have been
destroyed, so I cannot take you in with the truck.
To attempt to make your way in through the woods
and carry your belongings with you would be folly,
for the way would be long and winding and you
would run the risk of getting lost. Besides, there
are several of your companions who are sick and
unable to travel. Surely you do not want to desert
them. Now, what I wish to propose is this: You
all know the teamster has gone in to get more
mules. We expect him back any hour. When he
comes if you are still minded to quit, we will hire
an Indian guide and send you in by wagon. Until
he comes, I would ask you to continue at work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Our lights on the machine are ruined so we can
only work day times, and in the day time you are
in no danger from our enemies. Those of you who
do not work on the machine will throw up breastworks
all around the camp so that we will be well
protected at night."</p>

<p>When he ceased the Spaniards drew to one side
for consultation. In a few minutes Bossie came
forward and said in his quaint broken English:</p>

<p>"We stay till by and bye, wagon come, then
catchee town. We all likee Boss plenty. Likee
grub, likee job, but no likee mud, no likee fever, no
likee shooting all the time. We work till wagon
come&mdash;no more."</p>

<p>"Good," said Charley, "you can go back to work
now. It might be worse," he remarked to his chum.
"The machine will be kept going day times anyway."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<small>THE SEMINOLE LAD.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two lads next visited the hospital tent, where
they found the fever patients much improved but
the three machine men suffering greatly from their
burns, while Bob Bratton and the wounded Spaniards
were resting as comfortably as could be expected.
The boys did all they could to make the
sufferers comfortable, then sauntered out for a
look at the burned jungle. Here they met with a
scene of utter desolation. Many trees and stumps
were still burning, but the larger part of the jungle
had been swept clean. The shallow pools of water
had been dried up by the intense heat, leaving exposed
an expanse of black mud fissured by cracks.
Of the former multitude of snakes that had infested
the place they saw not one. Returning from the
destroyed jungle, the lads searched over the scene
of battle of the night before. They found blood on
the ground in several places, indicating that all
their bullets had not been wasted. Before entering
the tent, Charley paused and took a last look
around. Several Spaniards, under the Captain's direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
were throwing up a solid breastwork, close
to and surrounding the camp. The machine was
working steadily, and the slow moving ox carts
were crawling back from the distant timber with
their loads of wood. The Indian camp had been
outside of the fighting zone the night before. With
a sigh, the wounded lad entered his tent and throwing
himself on his cot, gave way to his despair.
Try as he might, he could see nothing but ruin for
himself and companions. There was little hope of
getting another crew for the machine. The departing
Spaniards would carry the story of their disasters
in with them, and it would be impossible to
induce others to come out. A negro crew might
be secured, but it would take time, and the lad knew
the colored race well enough to know that they
would not stick in the face of danger.</p>

<p>The crew's wages would take almost the last dollar
they had in the bank, and if the County insisted,
as he feared it would, on their rebuilding the destroyed
bridges, the reward for the convicts, the
money they had found in the old fort, and what
was due on the digging they had already done,
would be swept away to the last cent. In no direction
could he see any hope. In spite of all his
efforts and careful planning, their mysterious enemy
had triumphed, and he and his companions were
ruined. He did not blame the Spaniards for quitting.
The work was hard enough and dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
enough to bear, without the added risk of being
shot in the dark.</p>

<p>At last, worn out by his gloomy reflections, the
lad fell into a fitful slumber from which he was
awakened by Walter, who was pale of face and
excited.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Charley demanded as he
sat up on the edge of the cot. "You look as though
you had seen a ghost."</p>

<p>"I hate to tell you," faltered his chum, "but I
knew you would have to hear about it, so I ran
ahead to break the news to you myself."</p>

<p>"Out with it," Charley said. "I'm strong enough
to bear anything now."</p>

<p>"You know the Indian lad that drives one of the
wagon teams&mdash;the boy Willie John is so proud of&mdash;they
just found him dead on his load of wood&mdash;shot
through the heart."</p>

<p>"The fiends," said Charley, "to shoot a poor, innocent,
harmless child. They shall pay for it. Pay
for it dearly." He threw aside the tent flap and
strode out, Walter by his side babbling over the
details of the tragedy.</p>

<p>"You ought to have seen Willie John's face when
he found him," he said. "It was like a demon's for
a minute, then it became like stone."</p>

<p>Charley made his way out to the Indian camp,
where the Spaniards and the Americans were already
gathered. The squaws were breaking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
camp, while Willie John sat in one of the wagons
holding the dead lad in his arms.</p>

<p>"Willie John, Willie John," said Charley brokenly.
"We never thought anything like this would
happen. We never dreamed those fiends would
fire on you or the lad."</p>

<p>"Me understand," said the Seminole without
emotion. "You no to blame. Bad pale-faces in
wood did it."</p>

<p>"We will see that they are punished for it, Willie
John," Charley promised, with tears in his eyes.
"We will do all in our power to bring them to justice."</p>

<p>"Me understand," said the Seminole, and added
simply as he gazed down at the lad in his arms:
"Him was good boy. Him no smoke, no drink
wyomee. Him save every little bit of money he
get so by and bye him go to school all the same as
pale-face boy. Him was very good boy."</p>

<p>The boys watched the lumbering, slow moving
wagons out of sight with unashamed tears in their
eyes. Then Charley turned to the machine men.
"Rake out your fire and make everything snug on
the machine," he said quietly. "There will be no
more work for there will be no more wood."</p>

<p>When the machine men, their task done, had
gathered with the others at the camp, the lad addressed
them again.</p>

<p>"You have all seen what has happened to-day,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
he said quietly. "A bright, innocent, harmless child
murdered simply because he was working for us.
We hardly deserve the name of human if we do
nothing to avenge his death. It is getting too near
night to do anything to-day, but I am going to call
for volunteers to go with me to-morrow morning
to either capture his murderers or wipe them out of
existence. Who will go with me?"</p>

<p>His chums and the two engineers stepped
promptly to his side, and the Spaniards followed
one by one.</p>

<p>"Good," said the lad, with a sad smile. "We will
start at daylight."</p>

<p>There was no singing or laughter in the camp
that night, for each man carried to his tent with
him the reflection that the morrow might see him as
dead as the Indian child they were going to avenge.
There were plenty of men to act as guards for the
night now that the machine was not working, so
Charley retired early to his tent and soon fell
asleep. At daybreak the guards awoke him and his
companions as they had been ordered to do, and
reported that the night had passed off without
alarms. Chris soon had breakfast ready and over
cups of strong steaming coffee their plans for the
expedition were made.</p>

<p>When the sun arose ten Spaniards and seven
Americans armed with guns and pistols filed out of
the little camp and silently tramped away for where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a distant smudge of smoke showed the location of
the gunmen's campfire. Only enough more remained
behind to guard the camp.</p>

<p>The little party of avengers advanced with caution.
They marched in a twisting line so as to
always keep a hummock or a bunch of spruces between
them and the distant camp smoke so that
their approach would not be noticed. As they
slowly drew nearer double caution was observed,
but at last they came upon an open stretch of
prairie which they must cross to reach the thicket
in which the gunmen's camp was located.</p>

<p>"Here is where they take the alarm," commented
Charley, as they emerged out upon the open prairie.</p>

<p>But the little party crossed the open stretch without
any sign of life from the gunmen.</p>

<p>"They have either moved or are sound asleep,"
he said. "Get your guns ready. Don't fire unless
I give the word. Follow me, and make as little
noise as you can."</p>

<p>The little party filed into the thicket, the chums
and engineers in the lead and the Spaniards following
close behind. At the edge of the cleared camping
place the little party halted in horrified amazement.
They had come to avenge the killing of the
Indian lad, but another avenger had come before
them. Sprawled upon the ground in all manner of
attitudes, lay eighteen men&mdash;all dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lord!" breathed McCarty softly. "Who could
have done it?"</p>

<p>"There is only one answer to that question," said
Charley gravely. "Those whose right it was to do
it, if the taking of human life is ever right. Look
at those heads."</p>

<p>The others shuddered with horror as they gazed
upon the reddened skulls from which the scalp locks
had been skillfully removed. Aside from that nothing
had been touched, guns still lay where they had
fallen and tents and supplies were undisturbed.</p>

<p>"The Seminoles," exclaimed Walter, and his
chum nodded assent.</p>

<p>Two men were sent back to the camp for shovels,
and when they returned graves were dug in the
sandy soil and the dead men laid to rest. A search
of their clothing and belongings gave little clew to
the strange men's identity, but from the quantity of
tablets and powders found upon them, and their
dissipated appearance, the boys decided that they
were members of that deadly drug-crazed band of
New York gunmen.</p>

<p>Their sickening task finished, the little party
headed back for camp.</p>

<p>"I am glad, after all, that it is not by our hands
that they fell," Charley said to his chums as they
tramped along. "To take life, even in the heat of
passion, is a terrible thing."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, lad," said Captain Westfield reverently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
"The Good Book truly says, 'Vengeance is
mine, saith the Lord.'"</p>

<p>The little party arrived back in camp by noon.
Much to their surprise, they found Willie John
back again with his wagons busily engaged in making
camp.</p>

<p>"Me come back, haul more wood," explained the
Seminole simply.</p>

<p>During dinner there was great chattering and
whispering at the Spaniards' table, and after the
meal was over Bossie, always their spokesman, approached
Charley.</p>

<p>"Spanish <i>hombres</i> (men) no want to quit now,"
he said in his quaint English. "They likee boss,
they likee grub, likee job. They no be shot at
nights any more. They want to stay on job now.
They think it much more better."</p>

<p>"All right, Bossie," replied the lad listlessly. "We
can only work half time now until the mules come
and I can go in and get the electric light."</p>

<p>"I will be glad when this job is over," he told
Walter. "The violence, trouble, and bloodshed have
destroyed all my interest in the work. The gunmen
will bother us no more, but I am wondering
already where the enemy will strike next. The
gunmen were only tools."</p>

<p>"Cheer up," said his chum, with an attempt at
cheerfulness. "The darkest hour is always just before
the dawn."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<small>VISITORS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> and all in the camp now began to look forward
to the coming of Canady with the mules. The
Spaniards because, until a new light was installed,
they could only work half time and consequently
could only earn half their usual wages. The rest
of the party because they were getting really
alarmed over the Missourian's long absence.</p>

<p>"He ought to have been back long before this,"
said Charley, the day after the tragic discovery
of the dead gunmen. "If he does not show up
by to-morrow morning, I am going to hire a pony
from the Indians and start in and look for him.
Something surely must have happened to him."</p>

<p>"If you do go in you are liable to miss him on
the way," Walter objected. "He may come back
by one route while you are going in by another.
Better give him a little more time. Jim impressed
me as being perfectly well able to look out for himself."</p>

<p>"You don't think he could have been tempted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the big amount of money he carried?" asked Captain
Westfield, with some hesitation. "Five hundred
dollars is a lot of money to a poor man."</p>

<p>"But not to Jim," Charley said decidedly. "Jim
is a true Southerner and a thief is almost a curiosity
among Southern races. No, Jim would not
touch a cent that did not belong to him. Something
has happened to him, that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, if you go in to-morrow, I am going with
you," Walter said decidedly.</p>

<p>"We will talk that over later," Charley said.
"We have nothing to do to-day so we might as well
amuse ourselves and try to forget for a time that,
if we are not actually ruined, we are pretty close
to it."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," his chum agreed heartily.
"What shall the program be?"</p>

<p>"I would like to explore the country to the side
of the road a bit, say out where you and McCarty
went when you killed the deer. I have not been out
that way yet."</p>

<p>"Suppose we all go," Walter suggested. "All
can get away except the man running the machine,
and even a little change like that will do a fellow a
pile of good."</p>

<p>"Good!" Charley approved. "We will all go that
want to and make a day of it."</p>

<p>It developed that all the Americans were eager
for something in the way of a change. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Captain was willing to take a day off and Chris insisted
that his assistant Sam was now competent
to prepare a meal for those left behind. Armed
with guns and lunch baskets, and with Bob, the dog,
frisking ahead, the merry little party set out determined
to have a pleasant time.</p>

<p>Quail was plentiful and a great number were
bagged before the little party reached the prairie
regions with its sandy bottomed lakes. They
stopped by one of the lakes and rested at noon.
They had brought fishing tackle with them and
enjoyed huge sport pulling in the big fish with
which the lake was full. Several of these roasted
over the coals made a welcome addition to the lunch
they had brought with them.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent killing more quail, fishing,
following up a homing bee which led them
straight to a big hollow tree filled with delicious
honey, and digging in the mounds which dotted the
prairie. These mounds were found to contain
quantities of human bones, arrow and spear heads,
stone hatchets, and vessels of earthen ware. They
were evidently the relics of a race long since gone
out of existence, a race that lived in the country
long before the Seminole Indians.</p>

<p>Tired but happy, the little party got back to camp
just after sundown. Here a surprise greeted them,
for they found the sheriff, and half a dozen of his
aids, awaiting their arrival. The sheriff's face was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
very grave and he answered their cordial greetings
crisply.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I have a warrant for the
arrest of Charley West, Walter Hazard, Capt. Benjamin
Westfield, Bob Bratton, Will Kitchner and
C. P. McCarty (white), and Christopher Columbus
(negro)."</p>

<p>The little party stared at each other in stupefied
amazement.</p>

<p>"On what charge?" demanded Charley, recovering
his breath.</p>

<p>"On the charge of being the principals and accessories
before and after the fact in the murder of
one Levi P. Morton, late of New York City, on the
night of November 23d, 1913," read the sheriff
droningly.</p>

<p>"That gunman!" gasped Walter. "Why no one
murdered him, Mr. Sheriff. He was kicked to
death by mules he attempted to poison."</p>

<p>"I shall have to warn you that anything you say
can be used against you at your trial," said the
sheriff sternly. "I have found the grave of the
dead man near this camp."</p>

<p>"Rats!" sneered McCarty angrily. "No sane
judge would hold us ten minutes on such a charge."</p>

<p>"Well," observed the sheriff coolly, "you will
have a chance to test that. Even if I were convinced
of your innocence, I would have to arrest you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
just the same. When a warrant is given me it is
my sworn duty to serve it."</p>

<p>"The sheriff is right," Charley said hopelessly.
"We will have to go with him, and we might as well
do it without argument. The judge will turn us
loose as soon as he hears our story, but it will be
too late then."</p>

<p>"Too late for what, lad?" asked Captain Westfield.</p>

<p>"Why, can't you see this warrant is a put-up
job," Charley exclaimed impatiently. "Don't you
understand it's the latest move of the enemy to get
us out of the way while they disable the machine
and destroy our camp?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, I believe you're right," exclaimed McCarty.</p>

<p>"Right, of course I'm right," said the lad fiercely.
"What other reason could there be for such an
absurd charge? You will see that no one will appear
against us when we are brought up in court.
Well, the game's up, boys. We have all put up a
good fight, but this settles it. I would not give ten
cents for what we will find here if we return after
being set free. May we have time enough, Mr.
Sheriff, to pay off our men and pack up our
things?"</p>

<p>"You can have all night," replied the officer.
"We will not go in until morning. It's a long journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
for, with the bridges gone, we will have to
pick our way back through the woods."</p>

<p>After our little party had finished a silent,
gloomy supper, they retired to their tents to pack
up their scattered belongings.</p>

<p>Charley called the workers to his tent one by one
and gave each a check for a full month's wages.
He made all of them promise to stay and guard
camp and machine during their absence, but he
really had but little hope that they would remain
in camp long after all the Americans were gone.</p>

<p>Their packing done, the little party gathered
around the campfire as gloomy and disheartened a
little bunch of men as it would be possible to find.
One of the larger of the tents had been given up to
the sheriff and his posse, and to it the officer sent his
tired men early, saying he would stand guard over
the prisoners himself the first part of the night.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said, when the last one of his men
had retired, "I hate to execute this warrant. I had
to be stern to you before my men, for every one
of them wants my job and would be glad to make
any trouble they could for me at headquarters. Being
as we are alone together now, I will say that I
believe you fellows are as guiltless as a babe of the
crime with which you are charged. I believe, as
you say, that it's a frame-up, but I've got to take
you all in to answer to it, unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?" asked Walter eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Unless," said the sheriff suggestively, "you
overpower me, tie me up, and make your escape
to-night."</p>

<p>Charley grasped the meaning in the officer's
tones. "No, it would be of no use," he said. "It
might make you trouble and we would be no better
off, compelled to hide out in the woods, than we
would be in jail."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," the sheriff admitted. "It's
too bad, it's too bad."</p>

<p>"We thank you for your kindness," Charley said
gratefully. "We know what your duty demands
and do not blame you in the slightest for this. You
could not do otherwise."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you understand that," said the sheriff,
brightening. "By the way, I had to arrest your
teamster, too, day before yesterday, on the same
charge." He grinned at the recollection. "He was
just starting out for here with a new pair of mules
when we nabbed him. Lord, he fought like a wild
cat and swore like a pirate while we were taking
him to the lock-up."</p>

<p>"So that's why Jim hasn't come back," said
Charley, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"That's the reason," assented the sheriff. "He
hasn't had a hearing before the judge yet. My
eldest boy is looking out for the mules for him.
When I left, Lawyer Bruce was flying around trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to get Jim out. Swore he would have him set
free before noon."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Bruce know you were coming out for
us?" Charley inquired, with interest.</p>

<p>"I dropped him a hint," said the sheriff. "My,
you ought to have heard him rave. He had Jim
Canady's cussing beat a mile. He used longer
words, and more of them."</p>

<p>"I'm glad he knows the position we are in," said
the lad, with relief. "He may be able to help us in
some way."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, lad. Bruce will do all he can
for you&mdash;he's that kind," said the sheriff kindly.
"Now you had better all turn in and get a good
night's rest. It will be a long hard trip in to-morrow."</p>

<p>All hands thanked the kind officer and retired
to their tents, where they were soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Chris, who, as usual, was the first one out in the
morning, awakened the others with shouts of delight.</p>

<p>"Jim's coming," he cried in their ears. "Jim an'
Mr. Bruce and that little man, Jones. They are
within a half mile of camp."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<small>MR. JONES BUYS THE OUTFIT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Americans came tumbling out of their tents
just as Mr. Bruce, with his companions, rode into
camp.</p>

<p>"No questions, no questions, until we have had
something to eat," protested the lawyer good-humoredly,
as our little party crowded around him.
"We haven't had a bite to eat since yesterday noon.
Just fill us up with something hot and tasty and
we'll talk on anything you name. I am not going
to say another word on an empty stomach, except
to the sheriff here, and that only to tell him that
I've got an order from the judge revoking that
warrant he's got for all of you fellows, and that he
might as well trot right back to town."</p>

<p>"Not before breakfast," protested the officer vigorously.</p>

<p>"As these boys' counsel, I advise them not to
feed either you or your men," said the lawyer, with
twinkling eyes. "They ought to punish you by sitting
you in the corner and letting you watch the rest
of us eat."</p>

<p>"That would be inhuman," declared the sheriff.
"Um, man, just smell those fish frying and that
coffee steaming."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment Chris announced breakfast and
all filed in to where the little negro had the table
filled with fried fish, quail, ham and eggs, potatoes,
hot corn bread and coffee. Silence reigned supreme
as the hungry lawyer and his companions attacked
the savory food. When at last they had satisfied
their gnawing appetites the lawyer turned to the
sheriff. "You can run along home now," he said.
"Here's that paper I spoke about to show that
everything's all right and proper. You can leave
the boys with me now."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure but that I ought to take charge
of their pocketbooks for them if you are going to
remain here," said the sheriff, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I'll promise that their pockets will be fuller when
I leave them than they are now," said Mr. Bruce.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll go then," agreed the sheriff, with
a grin. "So long, boys, and the best of luck to
you."</p>

<p>"That's a true-blue old chap," remarked the lawyer,
as the sheriff departed. "We joke pretty rough
with each other sometimes, but I like him and I
think he likes me."</p>

<p>"He is good and kind," Charley agreed. "Do
you feel able to talk business now?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce lit a cigar and puffed in dreamy content
for a few minutes before replying.</p>

<p>"You know my friend Mr. Jones here, I believe?"
he said, with an airy wave of the hand toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
little man whose face at that moment looked as
though he had just taken a dose of castor oil.</p>

<p>"We have seen him before," said Charley coldly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones is a remarkable man, a very remarkable
man," said the lawyer, and the lad thought he
could detect a mocking note in Mr. Bruce's voice as
he continued. "Like many other remarkable men,
however, Mr. Jones has not until the present time
been able to gratify his greatest desire and ambition.
Is that not correct, Jones?"</p>

<p>"Go on. You're doing the talking," said the
little man grimly.</p>

<p>"That's so, I am," said Mr. Bruce, with the air
of one who had just been informed of a startling
fact. "You're a man of unusual observation and
intelligence, Jones. Well, gentlemen, even in childhood
Mr. Jones gave evidence of what was to be
his ruling passion in life. Before he had reached
the age of five, he nearly lost a finger in trying to
discover how his mother's clothes-wringer worked.
Your mother did have a clothes-wringer, didn't she,
Jones?"</p>

<p>"That was before the clothes-wringers came into
use," growled the little man testily. "Can't you
come to the point?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, so it was," agreed the lawyer. "I
have got my facts all mixed some way. Well, at
the age of six, Mr. Jones was licked by his father
for taking the family lawn-mower to pieces to discover
what made it cut grass."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"We didn't have any lawn or lawn-mower," declared
the little man mildly.</p>

<p>"At the age of seven Mr. Jones used to sit for
hours by the railroad track wondering what made
the locomotive's wheels go round. At ten he ruined
a bicycle, a present from an uncle, by taking it to
pieces trying to discover why it would keep upright
when moving but would fall down when stationary."</p>

<p>The boys grinned, and the little man squirmed
uneasily in his seat.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you have no doubt discovered by
now what Mr. Jones' ruling passion was, and is,
namely, an almost overwhelming love of machinery.
I have not sketched out his entire life, but I
have not the slightest doubt that this passion displayed
so early in life grew with the passing years
until it became a mania. I believe that, when Mr.
Jones came to own an automobile, the happiest
hours of his life were those spent under the machine
with a monkey-wrench in his hand and his
clothes covered with grease."</p>

<p>"Can't you come to the point?" demanded the
little man irritably.</p>

<p>"In just a minute, Jones," said the lawyer gently.
"Now, gentlemen, I have related all this to show
you how natural it was when Mr. Jones first laid
eyes on your magnificent machine he became possessed
of the desire to own it. His whole heart
and every fiber of his being yearned to possess that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
marvel of cog-wheels, levers, and power. The desire
grew so upon him that he could not sleep at
nights, and at last he came to me and begged me
to see if you would not sell out to him. I warned
him that you loved your work, and that nothing
but a very high price would tempt you to give it
up, but that has not diminished his ardor, and so
I brought him out here to see what could be done
in the matter."</p>

<p>The lads' hearts beat high with hope. Here was
a way out of their difficulties they had never
dreamed of. They managed to keep their delight
out of their faces, however, for they realized that
the lawyer was playing a deep game, which they
did not understand.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you will set an unreasonable
price on your outfit," said Mr. Bruce, "so I suggest
if you will entertain a proposition to sell, that you
let me conduct the negotiations. I would hate to
have Mr. Jones pay more for the machine than it is
worth to him."</p>

<p>The little man winced visibly and shifted uneasily
in his chair.</p>

<p>"We would sell, if we could get a proper price,"
Charley said slowly. "We are willing to leave the
matter in your hands."</p>

<p>"Good," said the lawyer. "Now we can get
down to business. Let's see; the machine cost
$12,000 laid down at Jupiter, I believe."</p>

<p>"I'll buy it for that," said the little man promptly,
while our chums held their breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so fast," said the lawyer. "I'm not setting
a price yet. I'm just figuring up things. Twelve
thousand dollars was the price at Jupiter, but it
cost a lot more to set it up and get it on the ground
to work; then, there's the camp outfit, mules, truck,
etc. The whole thing should be worth at least
$18,000."</p>

<p>"I'll take it at that," said Mr. Jones quickly.</p>

<p>"Don't be so hasty," reproved the lawyer. "I am
not half through my figuring yet. I believe the lads
here have done a lot of work which they haven't
been paid for yet."</p>

<p>"About $2,000 worth," Charley said; "then there
is $1,700 coming on work that Murphy did."</p>

<p>"That makes $3,700," said the lawyer with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It's highway robbery!" exclaimed the little man
excitedly.</p>

<p>"We haven't counted in the good will of the business
yet, nor the mental anguish my clients have
suffered from troubles caused by enemies to this
road-building. I think $25,000 would be a fair
selling price."</p>

<p>"It's blackmail!" shouted the little man. "It's
nothing but pure blackmail."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mr. Bruce calmly. "You know
you don't have to buy unless you want to. But I
haven't finished yet. The buyer would have to
keep on all the present crew, if they wish to stay.
The sick ones would have to be well cared for, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
their wages go on just the same as if they were at
work. He would have to rebuild all the bridges
destroyed between here and Jupiter, and, lastly, he
would have to pay to Willie John, the Seminole,
whose son was killed while working for the company,
the sum of $5.00 a week for life. That's my
proposition for my clients. Of course, if you do
not want to accept it, Mr. Jones, you do not have
to do so."</p>

<p>For a few minutes silence reigned in the tent.
Then the little man, with a groan, pulled out his
checkbook. "I give up," he said. "You've got me
where I can't do otherwise."</p>

<p>"Sensible man," approved the lawyer. "Now,
gentlemen, will you please call in your engineers
and teamster? I've got some papers I want all
hands to sign." The rest of the Americans were
quickly assembled in the tent, and the paper signed,
after which Mr. Jones handed the lawyer a check
for $25,000 and received the papers in exchange.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Jones," said the lawyer, as
he held the check in his hand, "this road building
could have been stopped long ago if its enemies had
been smart enough to do one little thing?"</p>

<p>"What was that?" inquired the little man, with a
display of interest.</p>

<p>"Pull up and destroy the surveyors' stakes," said
Mr. Bruce, smiling.</p>

<p>Chagrin swept over the little man's face. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
guess I am beginning to get old and feeble-minded,"
he said humbly.</p>

<p>"Not too old but to be watched, and carefully,
too," said the lawyer. "Gentlemen, I think Mr.
Jones would like to retire and rest up a bit, after
his hard ride. If you could place a tent at his disposal,
it would be a great favor. I would suggest
that a few men be placed around the tent until one
of you can ride in and get this check cashed."</p>

<p>"Think I would stop payment on it?" growled
Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>"You might, you know," said the lawyer quietly.</p>

<p>So Mr. Jones was escorted to a tent, and a guard
of Spaniards placed around it.</p>

<p>Walter offered to ride in on the little man's pony
to get the check cashed and the money placed to
their credit in the bank. Charley would have liked
to have made the trip himself, but his arm was paining
him so intensely that he decided to remain behind.
Soon after breakfast Walter rode away on
his errand.</p>

<p>"I am thoroughly bewildered," Charley said to
Mr. Bruce. "I don't see how you forced Jones to
buy us out at such an enormous price, and I do
not see any solution of our mystery. It is still a
mystery."</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed Captain Westfield. "I must
own up, I am as curious as a woman about it."</p>

<p>"I am willing to explain now," said Mr. Bruce,
with a smile. "It's a very simple affair, after all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<small>THE MYSTERY SOLVED.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bruce</span> paused before beginning his story. "I
take it that you are well satisfied with the settlement
you have made with Jones?" he asked.</p>

<p>"More than satisfied&mdash;delighted," said Charley,
at which sentiment Captain Westfield nodded his
head vigorously.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the lawyer. "I am glad of
that, for I must confess I have carried things with
a pretty high hand in this matter. I am almost
afraid to tell you the whole truth now, for you may
condemn me for the settlement I have made of your
affairs after I tell you everything, but I have acted
for what I thought was your best interests all the
way through."</p>

<p>"We believe that," said Charley simply. "But
for you we would have lost out completely. We
would not ask for particulars if it were not that
the mystery of the whole business still puzzles us."</p>

<p>"And yet it's a simple thing," said the lawyer.
"You gave me nearly all the clews to it that day
you called at my office in Palm Beach. You told
me of all the efforts that had been made to hold
up your work. You told me about the man Jones,
and what the agent at Jupiter had told you about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
his getting cipher telegrams from the state capital
and New York, and you also showed me a newspaper
clipping, telling of the efforts of a big company
to get free from the State of Florida a big
grant of land between Indiantown and the jungle.
Why, your mystery was nearly all solved in just
what you told me that day."</p>

<p>"I don't see how," said Charley bewildered.</p>

<p>"The connection was plain enough," said Mr.
Bruce, with a smile. "It was a big New York company
that wanted to get the land for nothing.
Jones was getting mysterious messages from New
York and from the state capital. You were almost
certain that Jones was the one back of all your
troubles. Well, the deductions from all those facts
were simple enough. Jones was evidently the agent
for the New York company. Jones was not trying
to kill any of you or to break up the machine. He
was simply trying to hold up and delay the building
of the road. Why did he want to hold up your
work, you will ask. Well, the answer is contained
in that newspaper clipping. The legislature will not
meet until next month, when they will likely give
the land grant to the company. The inference was
plain, Jones' company wanted to have the road
built, but not before they got the land from the
state."</p>

<p>"But why?" persisted Charley, still puzzled.</p>

<p>"That's the question that puzzled me," smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the lawyer. "It was what brought me out here the
first time to look over the ground, and I found that
you were carrying the answer around without knowing
it. You were like Jones was about the surveyors'
stakes. It was such a little thing that you
never thought it of any importance."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Charley, still mystified.</p>

<p>"Those bits of rock you had in your game bag
were phosphate at the highest grade," said the lawyer,
with a smile. "The company was asking the
state to give them millions of dollars' worth of
phosphate for nothing, trusting to the state's ignorance
of the value of the land."</p>

<p>"I see," said Charley excitedly, "they wanted to
hold the machine back from digging through that
land until they got the grant from the state. They
reasoned that, when the shovel began to throw out
that stuff, someone would be sure to recognize it,
and the news would leak out, destroying their
chances of getting millions of dollars for nothing."</p>

<p>"That's about the size of it," Mr. Bruce admitted.</p>

<p>"But I still don't see how you made Jones buy
our machine at such an enormous price," said the
lad.</p>

<p>"I am rather proud of that stroke," admitted the
lawyer. "Perhaps my method was not entirely ethical,
but, as a lawyer, I owed a duty to you, my
clients, before any abstract duty to the state. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
I got the lay of things, I began to study out how
I could turn my discoveries to your advantage. Of
course, I could have made public the discovery of
the phosphate and the grant would not be made,
but that would not repay you fellows for your
losses. So I hit upon a scheme which was simple
but effective. Do you remember I had you all sign
some papers the first time I came out here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Charley, "and I have often wondered
what they were."</p>

<p>"Each one has a homestead entry on 160 acres
of that phosphate land. The whole of them just
about covered the land for which the company was
asking a grant. I got those entries all filed in the
state land office, and that put an end to the grant
question, and it brought Jones to my office almost
foaming at the mouth, and ready to make almost
any kind of terms. That is how I was able to
make him buy your machine at a big price and
assume your indebtedness. The papers you all
signed to-day were a bill of sale and the relinquishment
of your homestead claims. They leave the
phosphate land open to grant again, if the state sees
fit."</p>

<p>"It looks to me," observed Captain Westfield,
"that we have given up millions of dollars to secure
thousands."</p>

<p>"That's one way of looking at it," replied the
lawyer dryly. "But let us see the other side. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
you held that land you would have to live on it for
four years before the state would give you title
to it. You would have to build a railroad to the
coast to get your phosphate out to market, and
you would have to finish up the county road you are
building, which would be a losing proposition from
now on. In other words, it would take four years
of your time, and about $300,000 of capital before
you would get anything out of the phosphate."</p>

<p>"You're right," Charley agreed. "The homesteads
would have just been white elephants on
our hands. There is one feature about our settlement
with Jones, however, that does not seem exactly
right to me. The law ought to punish him for
the killing of that Indian boy."</p>

<p>"That was the independent act of the gunmen,
not Jones' act," said the lawyer. "Jones gave them
orders not to hurt any of you, but just to frighten
you off the job. He was away in town when the
shooting was done. Of course, he is responsible,
in a way, for the gunmen were his agents. He
brought them out here. But how can it be proved
against him? The gunmen are all dead, and, while
we know Jones was responsible for your troubles,
we would have a hard job proving it, for he has
kept in the dark and covered up his tracks pretty
well."</p>

<p>"You're right," the lad admitted, "and I for one
am well satisfied with the way you have handled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
things. You have done the wisest thing all the
way through. We are lucky to get out of the business
so well off."</p>

<p>"You certainly are," agreed Mr. Bruce decidedly.
"There is one thing I have not told you about yet,
which will make you still gladder that you are out
of the business."</p>

<p>"What is it?" Captain Westfield asked.</p>

<p>"The county's road fund is exhausted," replied
the lawyer. "You would have had to wait until the
taxes are collected next year before you could have
gotten any money for your road work."</p>

<p>"Whew!" Charley whistled. "Then Jones has
bought $3,700 worth of bad debts?"</p>

<p>The lawyer chuckled. "Yes, and he knows it.
He's a pretty sore man just now. But you needn't
waste any sympathy on him. His company is a
rich one and can afford to wait a year for their
road money. The road will benefit them more than
anyone else, anyway. Well, that's all the story,
gentlemen, and, if you don't mind, I will lie down
and rest a while. I am not used to horseback riding,
and I'm just one big ache now. Jones and I
are going to stay out here with you until your
chum gets back. I want to do a little hunting while
I'm waiting, and I would like to get a look at
that old Spanish fort you told me about."</p>

<p>"We can go out there to-morrow, and hunt on
the way," Charley said, as he showed Mr. Bruce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to his own tent. "I will send Willie John out to
Indiantown to-day, and have him bring back ponies
for all hands. We will make a general holiday and
party of it."</p>

<p>Early next morning they all started out on the
proposed trip. Even Mr. Jones was released from
his tent and permitted to accompany the party. All
carried guns and supplies, and Charley also carried
a lantern and a supply of candles, for he was determined
to search closely the hole in which Walter
had found the gold and jewels.</p>

<p>Two days later the party returned, tired but
happy, their ponies loaded with game. Charley also
bore a second cylinder the same as the one Walter
had found.</p>

<p>Soon after they arrived Walter rode into camp
with the happy news that the check was cashed
and the money placed to their credit in the bank.</p>

<p>The next morning our little party packed up their
belongings and bid good-by to the engineers and
Spaniards, who had decided to stick by the job. To
each of the Spaniards they gave a $10 bill, and to
the engineers $20 each as a parting gift out of the
abundance they had made. Both the laborers and
engineers were sorry to see them go, and, for their
part, the boys and the captain disliked the parting,
for they had grown quite attached to their willing
helpers.</p>

<p>"Drop us a line once in a while," Charley told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
them, in parting. "We may get into some business
again where we will need men, and I do not know
where we could get better ones."</p>

<p>Mr. Jones had granted them the use of the mules
and wagon with the teamster to bring the rig back,
and with their things stowed in the wagon our
little party took their departure for Jupiter. As
Mr. Bruce had ridden out on one of the mules he
accompanied them back in the wagon.</p>

<p>"We are coming out of this business in fine
shape," Charley said, with satisfaction. "When the
jewelry is disposed of we will have over $7,000
apiece."</p>

<p>"Where are you going from here?" Mr. Bruce
inquired; "and what are your plans for the future?"</p>

<p>The chums looked blankly at each other. "Why,
we haven't even decided where we are going," Walter
gasped.</p>

<p>"Back to our old camping-place on the point for
me," said Captain Westfield decidedly. "I'm sick
for a breath of sweet, salt air once more. While
we are resting up we can decide what we are going
to do next." And so it was agreed.</p>

<p>At Jupiter our little party bid good-by to Mr.
Bruce and Mr. Jones, who returned to Palm Beach
on the first train. Before parting, Mr. Bruce drew
Charley to one side. "I am going to always regard
you and your chum as my mascots," he said. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
am ashamed to confess it, but yours was the first
and only case I have had since I was admitted to
the bar. It is always hard for a young lawyer to
get a start, and it is especially so in this state. You
have broken the ice for me, and now Mr. Jones
has retained me as counsel for his company, at a
salary of $3,000 per year."</p>

<p>"Good," said Charley heartily. "I congratulate
Jones on having sense enough to know that he
could not get a better attorney."</p>

<p>The friendly station agent was delighted to see
the little party back again, and pleased to learn that
they had done so well in their unpromising venture.
As he had just been granted a short vacation, the
boys invited him to camp out with them for a while,
an invitation which he was quick to accept.</p>

<p>And now all five of them are camped on that
sand point again, fishing, swimming, boating, getting
oysters and clams, hunting turtle eggs, and
having a good time generally. They are having
lots of fun, but, as Captain Westfield remarked the
other day: "I'll bet it won't be two weeks before
you lads will get tired of this, and will want to get
out and look for more trouble," to which Chris
sighed:</p>

<p>"Golly, I hopes not. Dis nigger is sho' enjoying
dis sunshine and fishin'."</p>
